<h1>THE CORNER HOUSE GIRLS ON PALM ISLAND</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—“I HEAR A NOISE”</h2>
<p>
“I hear a noise,” declared Dot, holding her
Alice-doll more firmly and staring all about into
the aisles of the chestnut grove.
</p>
<p>
“What kind of noise?” asked Tess, mildly
curious.
</p>
<p>
“Where does the sound come from?” demanded
Agnes in her abrupt way, but very carefully
picking brown chestnuts out of a prickly
burr—and with gloves on one may be sure. Catch
Agnes Kenway, the “beauty sister,” ever doing
anything to spoil her hands!
</p>
<p>
“Say! Is this a game? Like ‘cum-je-cum’?”
grumbled Sammy Pinkney, who did not wear
gloves and therefore had already got plenty of
“prickers” in his stubbed fingers, although the
nutting party had not been in the grove half an
hour. “I’ll bite. How big is the noise?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dot seriously, and answering
Sammy’s query first, “it is not a big noise at all.
I just manage to hear it. And it’s gone now.”
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be a wolf, or anything like that,” said
the eminently practical Tess, whose proper name,
Theresa, was seldom heard save from the lips
of her Aunt Sarah Maltby.
</p>
<p>
“O-oo!” squealed Dot, squeezing her Alice-doll
harder. “Don’t, Tess! A wolf!”
</p>
<p>
“There’d be some fun in that,” declared
Sammy, inspired instantly to romantic imagination.
“We’d have to hitch up the horses again,
and take to the sledge, and flee——”
</p>
<p>
“There are no horses, and it’s our automobile,”
interrupted Tess, with disdain.
</p>
<p>
“Aw—<em>you</em>!” gruffly exclaimed Sammy.
“Can’t you play this is the Russian steppes?”
</p>
<p>
“What’s Russian steps, Sammy? Aren’t they
like American steps?” asked Dot, who had a
bump of inquisitiveness second to none. “I know
what Russian sables are, and a Russian samovar,
for Ruth has one, an awful ugly thing. And
Russian car—caviar. Little black seeds that come
in a can and you eat ’em—if you are Russian.
But I’m not Russian and I don’t like ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“That steppes means plains, I guess. Anyway,
they are like the western prairies, and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
are wolves on ’em. And when they chase you
they are faster than the horses can run.”
</p>
<p>
“But our automobile would beat ’em,” announced
Tess confidently. “Neale O’Neil would
drive it so fast that no wolf could catch us,
Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“But we’re not in the automobile now,” said
the littlest Corner House girl who, if the truth
were known, loved to be thrilled.
</p>
<p>
“Sure not. We’re in a Russian sledge,” declared
Sammy, his own excitement feeding on
his vivid imagination. “And here come the
wolves!”
</p>
<p>
“O-oo!” shrieked Dot. “Where?”
</p>
<p>
Sammy pointed dramatically into the deeper
woods; but just where he pointed at that moment
Neale O’Neil appeared with a heavy sack on his
shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“That’s no wolf,” sighed Dot, disappointed.
“It’s only Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it might have been a pack of wolves
with a leader with slavering tongue.”
</p>
<p>
“Er—what’s <em>that</em>?” demanded the littlest girl,
hearing another new word. “What do they do
to ‘slaver’?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I——Oh, well, what does it matter?
Wolves’ tongues always do that,” rejoined the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
small boy in some disgust. “Anyway, here they
come!”
</p>
<p>
Dot murmured an appreciative and tremulous
“o-oo!”
</p>
<p>
“We got to whip up the horses like mad!”
cried Sammy, beating a fallen log with the stick
he had used to search the fallen leaves for chestnuts.
“See ’em come! They’ll get us——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy,” cried Dot all in a quiver, “don’t
let ’em <em>quite</em> get us.”
</p>
<p>
“Only one way to save our lives!” gasped the
almost breathless Sammy, glaring all about him.
</p>
<p>
“How? How?” cried Dot, in pretended alarm.
</p>
<p>
Tess Kenway remained rather unmoved by all
this. She was getting older, and the stimulant
of Sammy’s eager imagination had small effect
upon her mind. Besides, she took the attitude
of her eldest sister, Ruth, that most boys were a
trial.
</p>
<p>
“You’re mussing that fresh dress of your
Alice-doll, grabbing her that way,” Tess said
reprovingly to Dot.
</p>
<p>
But Dot was still enthralled. She saw the flying
sledge and the leaping wolves, and she hugged
Alice tighter than ever.
</p>
<p>
“O-oo!” she moaned.
</p>
<p>
“Only one way to save our lives!” repeated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
Sammy, beating off imaginary wolves over the
back of the imaginary sledge. “Give me that
baby!”
</p>
<p>
“Wha-a-at?” shrieked Dot, in real alarm now,
her voice mounting to a higher pitch. “My Alice-doll?”
</p>
<p>
“Only way to stop the wolves! They always
throw the children to them so the men and women
can escape!” declared Sammy, with as much confidence
as though he believed that in Russia children
were born and bred for that purpose, and
no other.
</p>
<p>
“Sammy Pinkney!” gasped Tess, herself disturbed
now by Dot’s agony.
</p>
<p>
“You want to be eat up by the wolves?” demanded
the panting Sammy, glaring at Dot and
reaching forth one hand to seize the Alice-doll
while he beat at the phantom wolves with the
other. “Give her here!”
</p>
<p>
“I shan’t either!” declared Dot, recovering
herself in some degree. “Sammy Pinkney! You
always get up just the meanest plays—so there!
I’d be eaten up by the wolves myself first, before
I’d give ’em my Alice-doll!”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grumbled Sammy. “That’s just like
a girl. Spoil everything every time and everywhere!
Let the old wolves eat you, then! I don’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
care,” and he shuffled away through the brown
and gold leaves to uncover more shiny, brown
nuts.
</p>
<p>
Agnes and Neale, who had looked on in some
amazement, burst into laughter.
</p>
<p>
“Such young ones!” murmured the beauty
sister.
</p>
<p>
“Can you beat ’em?” demanded Neale, who
was about her own age and Agnes’ closest and
dearest friend, bar none. “Where are Ruth and
Luke?”
</p>
<p>
“I saw them wandering off through the
woods,” replied Agnes, chuckling. “His hand
was in her’n and her hand was in his’n——”
</p>
<p>
“You be good!” exclaimed Neale, grinning.
“Dear me! They are getting soft on each other,
aren’t they?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Agnes, more kindly, “I can’t
blame Ruth. She was awfully worried about
him there in the summer when he was hurt, and
was ill so long. She can’t forget that she pretty
nearly lost him.”
</p>
<p>
“Luke’s a good scout,” agreed Neale. “But,”
and his eyes twinkled, “you wouldn’t let me hold
your hand that way, and moon about with you.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe in one form of holding hands only,”
declared Agnes sagely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” he asked quickly.
</p>
<p>
“At the manicure’s. And, dear me, after this
rough work my hands will need just that treatment,”
sighed the girl.
</p>
<p>
“And you with gloves on! Say, Aggie, you
are getting too finicky for words.”
</p>
<p>
Promptly she stuck out the tip of her tongue
at him. Agnes Kenway was not wholly past the
hoydenish stage, in spite of her grown-up airs.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Dot broke into the talk again with a
repeated statement:
</p>
<p>
“I hear a noise.”
</p>
<p>
“There you go again!” exclaimed Sammy. “Is
it a game?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” cried Tess suddenly, “I hear
it, too. I guess it’s no game. It’s somebody
calling.”
</p>
<p>
“Calling the cows, maybe,” said Agnes carelessly.
</p>
<p>
“Calling the sheep,” joined in Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Dot soberly, “It’s calling humans.
It said ‘Help!’ and they don’t call cows or sheep
that way.”
</p>
<p>
“Right for you, Dotums!” agreed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Wait,” advised Neale. “All keep still and
listen. Of course it isn’t Ruth and Luke? They
wouldn’t get so far away——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” broke in Agnes warningly.
</p>
<p>
They all heard it that time—a cry of faint
voices, and certainly the only word distinguishable
was “help.”
</p>
<p>
“What can it be?” demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Like to know what they want us to help ’em
about,” said Sammy. “Maybe it’s some fun.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Fun!’” repeated Tess scathingly, looking at
him.
</p>
<p>
Just then Ruth, the eldest sister of the four
Corner House girls, and Luke Shepard, the young
collegian, appeared walking hastily toward the
place where the party had been gathering nuts.
</p>
<p>
“They are all right, Luke!” was Ruth’s first
exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“I told you so, Miss Fussbudget,” he laughed.
“Did you hear somebody shouting, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, for help. What do you suppose it is?”
</p>
<p>
“We’d better go to see,” Ruth said confidently.
</p>
<p>
She, too, was a pretty girl; but she did not have
Agnes’ vivid coloring or volatile manner. Ruth
Kenway was graceful, rather mature in figure
and manner, and with the kindest smile in the
world. Having had to mother her younger sisters
when she was so young, the girl had acquired
this matronly appearance, although she was still
in her teens.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say!” broke in Sammy, who, from natural
obstinacy, opposed almost everything he did not
himself suggest, “let ’em come and ask us to
help. Maybe somebody will steal our nuts while
we’re gone. Or the auto.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t steal the machine,” said Neale. “It’s
locked and the key is in my pocket.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on,” Luke remarked. “I feel with
Ruth that we ought to look into this. It is easy
for something to happen in the woods.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grumbled Sammy. “What could happen
in this chestnut wood except getting prickers
into your hands? Huh!”
</p>
<p>
“You stay here and keep watch, Sammy,”
Agnes advised.
</p>
<p>
But that would not have suited Sammy in any
case. If there was a chance of something happening,
he wanted to be on the spot. So he went
along with the Kenway girls and the two young
fellows who accompanied them.
</p>
<p>
The faint calling was repeated and became
plainer as the party went forward. It was evident
they had started in the right direction. The
cries grew nearer and nearer.
</p>
<p>
“They are children lost in the wood!” exclaimed
Ruth, with confidence, hurrying forward.
</p>
<p>
“The poor children!” said Tess thoughtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, through a break in the thicker wood,
they saw three little figures. They were two
girls and a boy, and the oldest was not more than
Tess’ age, if as much. They screamed again
when they saw the Kenway party, and began to
run to meet them.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh!” screamed one. “Daddy’s hurt!
He’s killed! Come help him!”
</p>
<p>
“Where is he?” Ruth demanded.
</p>
<p>
“How is he hurt?” asked Luke, quite as practical.
</p>
<p>
The oldest child answered Luke’s question
first. “He fell out of a tree. He was shaking
down chestnuts to us. And we can’t wake him
up.”
</p>
<p>
The older members of the Kenway party
looked at each other seriously. It might be, as
this little girl intimated, that her father had been
killed in falling from the tree.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—A DIFFICULT CASE</h2>
<p>
The four orphaned Kenway sisters lived in
Bloomsburg when they were first introduced in
the initial volume of this series, called “The Corner
House Girls.” Ruth, the eldest, had been
doing her best for months to mother her sisters
and to take care in addition of Aunt Sarah
Maltby, who really was a trial.
</p>
<p>
At a time when Ruth scarcely knew which way
to turn for money to support the family, Mr.
Howbridge, a lawyer of Milton, appeared with
really wonderful tidings. A distant relative of
the Kenways, Uncle Peter Stower, had died and
left the four Kenway girls all his property. This
included the Stower homestead in Milton, known
far and wide as the old Corner House.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge was appointed guardian of the
girls, as well as executor of the Stower Estate,
and Ruth, Agnes, Tess and Dot went to Milton,
taking Aunt Sarah with them, and began what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
proved to be a most interesting and exciting existence
in the old Corner House—and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
How they made the most delightful friends and
had the most wonderful adventures is told in the
succeeding volumes of the series, and include
experiences at school, tenting on the seashore,
taking part in a school play, finding a very odd
treasure, the discovery of which aided very needy
people, adventures on a delightful motor tour.
It was in the seventh volume, “The Corner House
Girls Growing Up,” that it seemed as though
Ruth, who had then left school, had actually met
the young man fated to be her partner in life
when they both should grow older. Luke Shepard
and his sister, Cecile, became as close friends of
the Kenways as Neale O’Neil had previously become.
</p>
<p>
The eighth book of the series, “The Corner
House Girls Snowbound,” told of exciting adventures
in a winter camp in the Great Woods, and
related the recovery of the Birdsall twins who
had run away from Mr. Howbridge’s guardianship
because they had got an entirely wrong
impression of what a guardian was. At the time
of this present nutting expedition, the Birdsalls
were both at boarding-school and had learned to
love Mr. Howbridge very much indeed, finding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
him, as the Kenways had, a delightful mentor and
friend.
</p>
<p>
The ninth volume of the series related the
story of the girls’ experiences on a houseboat, as
well as introducing Neale O’Neil’s father who
was long supposed to have lost his life in Alaska.
The excitement of these incidents was scarcely
over when Tess and Dot and Sammy Pinkney
managed to get mixed up with a certain gypsy
tribe; so the volume immediately preceding this
present story, entitled “The Corner House Girls
Among the Gypsies,” had in it quite as much fun
and as many thrills as any of the previous volumes.
</p>
<p>
Fall had come since then, and school had
opened for all but Ruth. This was on a certain
Saturday after the frosts had opened the chestnut
burrs, and Luke Shepard had come from college
to spend the week-end at the Corner House.
A nutting expedition was suggested over night,
and early on this morning Neale O’Neil, who still
acted as the Kenways’ chauffeur, had got out the
touring car and had driven the party of young
folks to the only chestnut wood left standing,
because of the blight, in the vicinity of Milton.
Sammy Pinkney had, as usual, attached himself
to the party, for he had the nature of a barnacle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
The scene just enacted, and the conversation of
the seven members of the nutting party, should
serve to introduce them to those new readers who
have not previously become acquainted with the
Corner House girls and their closer comrades.
It was Ruth, of course, who took the lead when
the three strange children made their announcement
of the disaster that had happened in the
woods.
</p>
<p>
“Where is your father lying?” she asked the
spokesman of the trio.
</p>
<p>
“Over there,” said the girl, pointing rather
vaguely, it must be confessed.
</p>
<p>
“Who is with him?” again questioned Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! He’s all alone. He was getting nuts for
us. And when he fell and we couldn’t wake him
up, we all ran away.”
</p>
<p>
“We—we were going home to tell mamma,”
sobbed the smaller girl.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know where she is,” said the boy,
who was staring at Sammy Pinkney.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know where your mother is?”
cried Agnes. “Fancy!”
</p>
<p>
“She’s at home,” said the first speaker.
</p>
<p>
“But we don’t know where home is,” declared
the boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
“I declare! You are lost!” said Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“What is your name?” Ruth asked of the older
of the three.
</p>
<p>
“Pendleton. I’m Margy Ortwell, and my sister
is Carrie Purvis, and my brother is Reginald
Shotford Pendleton.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grumbled the boy, “and they call me
‘Reggy’ and I hate it.”
</p>
<p>
“Make ’em call you ‘Shot,’” suggested Sammy
promptly. “That’s a dandy name. Sounds
like you belonged out West—or—or was one of
those moving-picture fellows. Yep; Shot Pendleton
sounds good to me.”
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil shouted with laughter, and Luke
grinned broadly. But this was no time for laughter
in the opinion of the older girls. That man
might really be dead.
</p>
<p>
“Come! Lead us back to where your father
has fallen,” said Ruth urgently, to Margy Pendleton.
</p>
<p>
The little girl turned rather waveringly and
started off through the thicker wood. But her
brother cried:
</p>
<p>
“Hey! Where you going, Marge? That ain’t
the way we came.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ’tis, Reggy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aw, call me Shot. This fellow is right,” said
Reginald, nodding at Sammy. “And, anyway,
that isn’t the way to where daddy is.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you youngsters know how you came to
this place?” asked Luke Shepard.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! You are really lost, are you?” Agnes repeated.
</p>
<p>
“How can we be lost when we are with you
folks?” asked the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t beat that for logic,” muttered the collegian.
But like the other older ones he was troubled.
“Go ahead and let’s see how we come out.”
</p>
<p>
The wood grew thicker as they progressed, and
it was hard on the little folk. It was Ruth who
called a halt.
</p>
<p>
“It cannot be that they came this way, Luke,”
she said. “They could not have got through
these briars.”
</p>
<p>
“If they did,” muttered Neale O’Neil, “they
left no trail behind them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” sobbed little Carrie
Pendleton. “Then we’ve lost daddy and we’ll
never find him again!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course we’ll find him, child,” cried Agnes
soothingly, “only not in this direction.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but where shall we look?” murmured
Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mamma will scold us dreadfully if we come
home without daddy,” sobbed Margy.
</p>
<p>
Luke and Neale, as well as Ruth and Agnes,
had become much troubled. It was evident that
the Pendleton children had been so startled by
their father’s fall and subsequently so frightened
by his being unconscious, perhaps dead, that they
knew very little of the course they had taken
through the woods. They had run, crying and
shouting, without any regard as to paths or
directions. And now to locate the place
where the accident had occurred was going to
be difficult.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do, Luke?” demanded Ruth
of the young collegian.
</p>
<p>
But it was Agnes, with her complete trust in
Neale, who hit upon the more direct scheme to
solve the problem. She exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Neale O’Neil! You’re so awfully smart, why
don’t you find out where the poor man is? You
have said there isn’t a place about this part of
the country that you haven’t tramped through.
Can’t you identify the spot where these poor kiddies
left their daddy?”
</p>
<p>
“Good idea, Aggie,” said the boy. “Wait.
Give me a chance to cross-question them. Here,
little folks, don’t cry any more. Stop crying and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
answer a few questions, and I promise to find
your father.”
</p>
<p>
His assurance impressed the frightened Pendletons,
small as they were. Margy and Reginald
ceased their tears, at least.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know where we were when it happened,”
said Margy doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Now, just wait,” said Neale. “Tell me first
of all where you live?”
</p>
<p>
“On Plane Street,” was the prompt reply.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know where that is!” cried Agnes. “It’s
’way out on the west side of town.”
</p>
<p>
“Just leave this to me. Don’t interrupt, Aggie,”
said her boy friend. “Now, Margy, how
did you get to these woods?”
</p>
<p>
“We walked. We started right after breakfast,
and we brought our lunch——”
</p>
<p>
“And we eated—eated it all up,” gulped Carrie,
the smallest Pendleton. “And I’m hungry,”
she added in a mournful tone.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, don’t be a baby,” grumbled her brother.
“Of course you’re hungry. You always are.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, hold on!” urged Neale again. “You
walked out to the woods. And from Plane Street?
Then I guess you got into the woods about where
that old quarry is, didn’t you? That deep hole in
the ground where it is all rocks?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Margy. “And there’s
a railing round it, and daddy told us not to go
near, for the railing might break if we leaned
on it.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the place,” Neale said. “Now we’re
getting to it. And after you got into the wood a
way you saw a place where a little house had
been burned down—oh! A long time ago?”
</p>
<p>
“You bet we did!” interrupted Reginald. “But
I got some smut on my hands just the same,”
and he displayed two very grimy hands.
</p>
<p>
“Getting warmer,” laughed Neale, yet he was
serious the next moment. “Where did you go
after you passed that burned cabin?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, we went after nuts,” said Margy soberly.
</p>
<p>
Luke grinned. “That stumps you, my boy?”
</p>
<p>
“Not so’s you’d notice it. I know that part
of the wood. I know where the only good trees
are in that direction. Now, see, Margy: Did you
pass a dead tree with no leaves on it—Oh! A tall
tree?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we did!” cried Reginald. “And we
found our first nuts under it.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, shucks!” exploded Sammy Pinkney.
“How’d you do that? Nuts under a dead tree?
Rats!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think you are the most impolite boy, Sammy,”
murmured Tess admonishingly.
</p>
<p>
“But we did,” said Margy. “I remember.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you did,” said Neale quickly.
“There is a fine big chestnut tree right next to
that dead oak. I remember it. When the burrs
fall and the nuts scatter, of course some of them
fall under the dead tree.”
</p>
<p>
“I got a pocket full, so there!” said Reginald,
looking hard at Sammy.
</p>
<p>
“Aw,” muttered Master Pinkney, but was otherwise
dumb.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” Neale went on cheerfully. “We
are getting on. And where did you go next?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, we went right on,” said Margy. “And
we put the nuts we found in a bag that daddy
carried. He said maybe we’d get enough to sell
some.”
</p>
<p>
“But I want them to eat!” cried Carrie, who
was evidently a child with an appetite not easily
appeased.
</p>
<p>
“How long was it before your father climbed
the tree?” was Neale’s next question.
</p>
<p>
“Pretty soon after we got into the real woods,”
said Margy eagerly. “There was a fence there,
for Daddy got a pole from it and knocked off
some of the lowest burrs. Then he climbed up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
And a branch broke and—and—Oh! Oh! I know
he must be dreadfully hurt, for he wouldn’t
speak to us after he fell.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” exclaimed Neale, starting off in a
hurry. “I know just where that old fence is.
All we’ve got to do is to find this end of it and
then follow it up until we come to the place.”
</p>
<p>
“The poor man!” whispered Ruth to Luke, as
the party set off in the wake of Neale O’Neil and
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But Agnes said to Neale, in a very broken
voice:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! Suppose he is dead? What ever
shall we do?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—THE PENDLETONS’ TROUBLES</h2>
<p>
They came to the fence, as Neale O’Neil had
said they would, and then, after following it a
little way, Margy shouted aloud and ran ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Here he is! Here is daddy!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
Her brother and sister followed closely on her
heels, and the Kenway party came afterward, but
almost as quickly. They saw a man lying on the
ground, and at first he lay so still that the older
girls and Luke and Neale did fear that Mr. Pendleton
was dead.
</p>
<p>
Then——
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Agnes, with a sudden intake of
breath. “His eyes are open.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s alive, all right,” said Luke Shepard.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Daddy! Daddy!” Margy cried, over and
over.
</p>
<p>
“Margy,” the man murmured, “and Carrie,
and Reggy——”
</p>
<p>
“No, Daddy,” said the little boy very decidedly,
“I’m going to be Shot Pendleton after this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
This boy says it’s a better name, and I like it.
‘Reggy’ sounds as if I ought to have curls.”
</p>
<p>
At another time Mr. Pendleton would very
likely have laughed, for he was a man who had
tiny, humorous lines about his eyes, and the corners
of his mouth more often turned up than
down. So Ruth said, at least, and she was very
observant.
</p>
<p>
She went forward with Agnes and stooped over
the man on the ground. Agnes clung to her sister’s
hand. The older boys stood back a little.
</p>
<p>
“Are you hurt?” Ruth Kenway asked softly.
</p>
<p>
“I believe I am. But I do not know how badly.
I cannot move without feeling the most terrible
pain in my back. I fell from that limb up there,”
and he pointed up into the tree under which he
lay.
</p>
<p>
“I bet he’s broken all his bones,” stated Sammy
Pinkney with much confidence.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hush!” cried Agnes pityingly.
</p>
<p>
“Sammy Pinkney!” exclaimed Tess, “you
sound as though you hoped he had.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, folks do break their bones falling from
trees. My mother says so.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s to keep you from climbing them,”
Tess rejoined decidedly. “Of course this little
girl’s father isn’t badly hurt.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tess would make the best of any catastrophe,”
chuckled Luke. “Let’s see if we can lift
him, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait!” commanded Ruth. “Can you bear
to stay as you are for a while?” she asked Mr.
Pendleton.
</p>
<p>
“If I lie still—don’t try to move—I seem to be
all right,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said the oldest Corner House girl,
“you run and bring the car, Neale. Get it in here
just as close as you can. Then when you and
Luke lift him you will not have so far to carry
the poor man, and,” she whispered the rest in
Luke’s ear, “if he is seriously hurt it will not
rack him so badly.”
</p>
<p>
“Thoughtful girl,” said Luke proudly. “Go
ahead, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bring the car around to this other road.
It is not far out to the quarry. And maybe I can
drive in to the burned cabin. There used to be a
road to it.”
</p>
<p>
He started on the run as soon as he had spoken.
The others gathered around the fallen man. Dot
hugged up her Alice-doll, and remarked:
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad he isn’t dead. I don’t think I should
like dead folks. And isn’t it lucky Sammy’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
wolves didn’t find him here while his children
were hunting for us?”
</p>
<p>
Carrie, the smallest Pendleton, gasped a horrified
“Oh!” Then she asked: “Are there wolves
in the chestnut woods—like the wolf in ‘Little
Red Riding Hood’?”
</p>
<p>
“The wolves are in Sammy’s mind,” said
Agnes cheerfully. “And wolves in your mind
never bite.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grumbled Sammy, “how do you know
there aren’t really, truly wolves here?”
</p>
<p>
“You never saw any, Sammy Pinkney!” exclaimed
Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I never looked for any,” he declared.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” said Dot with determination,
“they shan’t have my Alice-doll. I won’t save
our lives by throwing her to ’em, so there.”
</p>
<p>
“There aren’t wolves here, are there, Daddy?”
asked Margy Pendleton of the injured man.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t expect ever to see any,” he said
faintly. “I—I don’t know what your mother
will say to this, Reginald——”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not Reginald,” exclaimed the little boy
anxiously. “Do call me Shot. Please, Daddy!”
</p>
<p>
This time his father managed to call up a
smile. “All right, my boy. As you had nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
to do with choosing your name, I don’t know but
you should be allowed to use it as you see fit.
Your great-uncle, Silas Shotford, was a very
good man. Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“Does it hurt you, Mr. Pendleton?” asked
Ruth at this point. “Are you in pain? Can we
help you?”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid there is nothing you can help me
about, Miss,” said the man. “If I move that
arm it seems to send a shock through my nerves.
This is going to be awful,” he murmured, “if I
am made helpless.”
</p>
<p>
“What is your business, Mr. Pendleton?”
asked the collegian bluntly. “If you are laid up
will it matter seriously in your domestic affairs?”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you right now, young man,” said Mr.
Pendleton more vigorously, “that nothing could
be worse than this accident, it seems to me. Oh!
nothing could be worse.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry to hear you say that,” Luke rejoined,
but cheerfully. Ruth gave him an illuminating
look. “You know, Mr. Pendleton, this is
a time when friends come mighty handy to a
man——”
</p>
<p>
The man’s face fell. He shook his head despondently.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got very few friends just now, and no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
work at all. I—I was discharged from my last
position two months ago and have been unable
to find anything to do at all. I tell you frankly
that I am in the worst possible shape to endure
a sick spell.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t feel downhearted, Mr. Pendleton,”
Ruth said quickly. “Perhaps you will not be laid
up long after all. And when you are well I am
sure we can find something to do. My name is
Kenway. I live with my sisters in the old Corner
House.”
</p>
<p>
“I know you do, Miss,” said Mr. Pendleton.
“I have seen you girls before. But I doubt if you
could find me work.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, we can,” she said. “Or, at least,
our guardian can. Mr. Howbridge, the lawyer,
is our guardian.”
</p>
<p>
The man again shook his head, and his brow
was furrowed.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t help me in that way, Miss Kenway,”
he said. “And I doubt if your guardian
would let you.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, what do you mean?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
He looked about quickly. His three children
were with Tess and Dot and Sammy, a little distance
away. The look in his eyes now was one
of mental pain, not physical.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss Kenway. I will be frank with you.
I was discharged from Kolbeck and Roods because
goods were lost from the storeroom—stolen.
They accused me. And although they could not
prove it, neither can I disprove it. Nobody else
in Milton will give me work.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Pendleton!” cried tender-hearted
Ruth, “isn’t that too bad? But of course Mr.
Howbridge will find something for you to do just
the same, and as soon as you get well.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you go away from Milton and
get work where folks didn’t know about this
trouble?” asked Luke bluntly.
</p>
<p>
“You see, we partly own the home we live in
on Plane Street,” explained the man, with a
groan, as he moved restlessly. “Ah! That hurts.
I’ve done something to my back, I fear. And my
poor wife——
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s that way. We were paying for our
home on the installment plan. If we move away
we shall lose all we have put into it, for we could
not sell our equity at this time. Real estate
sales are at a low ebb, you know. I don’t know
what to do.”
</p>
<p>
“I think those folks who say you stole are
real mean!” cried Agnes warmly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” returned Mr. Pendleton. “I
know that no Pendleton was ever a thief. But
there are things about the robbery that look bad
for me. I admit that. But when they turned
me out without waiting to see if the real thief
would not be found, I think they did treat me
pretty mean.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll say they did!” exclaimed Luke.
</p>
<p>
They heard then the horn of the Kenway car,
and a minute or two later Neale came hurrying
through the woods.
</p>
<p>
“It’s only a little way to the burned cabin,” he
said. “I’ve turned the car around, and if we can
lift him easily I am sure the car won’t jounce
very much getting back to the main road. Come
on, Luke.”
</p>
<p>
“Do be careful, Neale!” begged Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“You girls take the little folks on ahead,” advised
Luke. “Then Neale and I will bring Mr.
Pendleton.”
</p>
<p>
The boys waited until the others were gone
before touching the injured man. The latter muttered:
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid something is broken. I don’t
know how much handling I can stand. Ah! This
is awful!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
And it was true that when Luke and Neale
raised him from the ground the poor man
screamed aloud and instantly fainted.
</p>
<p>
The injured man remained unconscious until
the boys got him into the automobile. The Kenway
car was a big, seven-passenger machine. But
when the whole party was in it, it certainly was
crowded.
</p>
<p>
Luke held the sinking form of Mr. Pendleton
upright against the cushions. He was glad the
man was unconscious. The older girls tried to
hush the weeping Pendleton children. The three
other little folks were in front with Neale O’Neil,
and even Sammy Pinkney was subdued.
</p>
<p>
Neale drove the car as carefully as possible,
and in half an hour it stopped before the little
cottage on Plane Street. There was a telephone
next door, and before even the older boys carried
the injured man into the house, Ruth had called
their family physician, Dr. Forsyth.
</p>
<p>
“And remember, Doctor,” the girl said firmly,
“whatever the bill is, it is a Kenway bill. You
understand?”
</p>
<p>
“I understand that Ruth Kenway is up to one
of her usual blessed tricks,” rejoined the doctor
over the wire. “I will be right over.”
</p>
<p>
Neale drove Luke and the little folks home,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
while Ruth and Agnes remained with the frightened
Mrs. Pendleton until Dr. Forsyth arrived
and had made his examination. He soon had Mr.
Pendleton much more comfortable both in mind
and body.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing broken,” the physician said comfortingly.
“Your back is strained and you’ve got
to lie quiet. But we’ll have you up in a couple
of weeks, Mr. Pendleton.”
</p>
<p>
He could see, as well as the girls, that the little
family were in straitened circumstances. He
gave Mrs. Pendleton a warm handclasp as he left
and said:
</p>
<p>
“I will come in once in a while to see how he
does. But do not let my coming worry you, Mrs.
Pendleton. I understand your circumstances,
and you tell your husband that he can be of easy
mind. If there should be anything due for my
services, its payment has already been arranged
for.”
</p>
<p>
“Those blessed Kenway girls!” exclaimed Mrs.
Pendleton. “I don’t know how I can ever thank
them.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—WAS IT FOOLISH?</h2>
<p>
Ruth, and her three sisters as well, loved to
play “Lady Bountiful.” Having been placed for
a time in close financial straits themselves, the
older girls at least well understood the plight of
those unfortunate people whom they met who
were short of funds.
</p>
<p>
The condition of the Pendletons’ exchequer was
a source of worry to Ruth especially. She had
ways of helping the children and Mrs. Pendleton
which were not too obvious; but how to aid the
man of the family when he could once more get
about was a question not so easily answered.
</p>
<p>
She saw Mr. Howbridge one day in his office
and put the matter up to her guardian with her
usual practical sense.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Oscar Pendleton does not impress me at
all as a man who would commit a crime. I do not
see how he came to be accused by his employers.
There is either something very much the matter
with the judgment of the members of that firm,
Kolbeck and Roods, or there is something so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
queer in the affair that it needs expert looking
into.”
</p>
<p>
“You think he could not have been tempted to
steal, Ruth?” asked Mr. Howbridge, giving her
trouble the attention that it deserved, for he knew
well her sound sense.
</p>
<p>
“A man with a nice wife and three such cute
kiddies? Impossible!”
</p>
<p>
“If he needed more money than he was making?”
</p>
<p>
“I have asked Mrs. Pendleton for the particulars—as
she knows them. The goods stolen could
not have been sold under cover for more than a
thousand dollars. And Mr. Pendleton was earning
a fair salary and they were getting on well,
and paying for their home. He would be crazy
to do such a thing for a mere thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“That sounds reasonable,” replied the lawyer.
“I tell you what I will do, Ruth. I’ll have one of
my clerks look up the case and get all the particulars.
Perhaps something can be done to explain
the matter and relieve Oscar Pendleton of the
onus of this charge.”
</p>
<p>
“That is my good guardian!” cried Ruth.
“You are a regular fairy godmother. You——”
</p>
<p>
She suddenly stopped to cough a little. Mr.
Howbridge frowned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“What does Dr. Forsyth mean by letting you
get such a cold on your chest?” the lawyer demanded.
“I thought I paid him to keep you Corner
House girls in good health.”
</p>
<p>
“Chinese style?” laughed Ruth. “Well, his
system has slipped a cog somehow, Guardy, for
both Agnes and I have colds.”
</p>
<p>
The colds did not enter into the consideration
of the two older Kenway sisters when it came to
the night of Carrie Poole’s big party. The Pooles,
who lived in a big house out on the Buckshot
Road, always gave several very enjoyable entertainments
during the winter season. The date of
the first one of this season was close at hand, and
Ruth and Agnes had insisted on having new
frocks for the occasion.
</p>
<p>
That brought Miss Ann Titus into the old Corner
House for several days; for after all, nobody
could quite cut and fit a party dress like the gossipy
spinster whom Tess had once called “such
a fluid talker.” It was from the birdlike Miss
Titus and her rather tart tongue that the Corner
House girls learned of another slant in the Pendleton
matter.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I got plenty of work, the goodness’
knows,” Miss Titus observed in response to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
query from Aunt Sarah Maltby, in whose room
the seamstress always worked when she was at
the Corner House. “I was that glad when Mrs.
Pendleton said she couldn’t have me this fall as
usual, that I didn’t know what to do. It give me
a chance to take on other folks that could afford
to pay better,” and Miss Titus sniffed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Agnes who chanced to be
present, “you know Mrs. Pendleton, then? You
know her husband was hurt, of course?”
</p>
<p>
“I know they say he was hurt,” responded the
sharp-tongued woman promptly. “But as to
that——”
</p>
<p>
“We know he was hurt, Miss Titus,” interposed
Ruth, smiling. “For we found him after
he fell in the woods and we took him home in our
car.”
</p>
<p>
“Do tell!”
</p>
<p>
“And we think the Pendletons are very nice
people, if unfortunate,” added Ruth, thinking it
better to warn the seamstress against going too
far. Ruth abhorred ill-natured gossip, and Miss
Titus was inclined to repeat the bitter dregs of
neighborhood news.
</p>
<p>
“Well, handsome is as handsome does,” said
Miss Titus, with a toss of her head. “I must say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
I think Mrs. Pendleton is a nice woman, and her
children are as well behaved as any. But that
man——”
</p>
<p>
“You mean Mr. Pendleton,” said Ruth gravely.
“We know all about his trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“And I think it is a shame that Kolbeck and
Roods should have made such an accusation
against him,” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Hoity-toity!” exclaimed the seamstress.
“You have gone off the handle just the same as
usual, Aggie Kenway. The man certainly stole
those goods.”
</p>
<p>
“Never!” murmured Ruth, almost in horror.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he did. I know Mrs. Kolbeck. She told
me all about it. Her own son—you know she’s
Mr. Kolbeck’s second wife and her name was
Stumpf before she married Kolbeck. Well, Israel
Stumpf, Mrs. Kolbeck’s own son, told her there
wasn’t a doubt but that Pendleton—perhaps with
somebody to help him—stole those bolts of silk
and satin and sold them down to New York.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I can’t believe it!” murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a story, I don’t care what they say,” said
Agnes hotly. Agnes could never be anything but
partisan. She was always much in favor or much
against everybody whom she knew.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Israel Stumpf works right there in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
wholesale house, and he ought to know all
about it,” declared Miss Titus, nodding emphatically.
</p>
<p>
“Why ought he to know, Miss Titus?” asked
Dot, who proved on this occasion to be “a little
pitcher with big ears.”
</p>
<p>
“Because he worked right there with Pendleton.”
</p>
<p>
“Would that make him know everything about
it?” Dot pursued, with her usual insistence.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” was the thoughtless reply.
</p>
<p>
“Then why didn’t he see Carrie Pendleton’s
father do it—do whatever he says he did?”
</p>
<p>
“Good gracious alive!” ejaculated Miss Titus.
“Was there ever such a child for asking questions?
I should think your jaws ’ud ache trying
to find out things.”
</p>
<p>
“They don’t,” said Dot, rather hurt.
</p>
<p>
“And I should think,” went on the seamstress,
“that you had asked so many questions that there
wasn’t another thing in this world for you to
learn. Is there anything that you really don’t
know, that you’d like to have me tell you, Dorothy
Kenway?”
</p>
<p>
Dot brightened tremendously. She became
quite eager.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, Miss Titus! There’s one thing that’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
been bothering me for a long time and nobody—nobody
can’t seem to tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell Miss Titus, honey,” said the woman,
who really loved the little girl, after all. “Maybe
I can give you the answer.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then,” said Dot, coming nearer to lean
against the woman’s knee, “tell me, will you
please, why it is little fishes don’t drown before
they grow up and learn to swim?”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
It was quite evident that the story of Mr. Pendleton’s
misfortune was spreading all through
certain strata of Milton society. Although Ruth
was sorry for this fact, she could only hope that
Mr. Howbridge’s clerk could uproot some information
regarding the robbery of the Kolbeck and
Roods warehouse that would explain away the
suspicion attached to the unfortunate man.
</p>
<p>
For neither she nor Agnes, nor Neale nor Luke,
believed that a man like Oscar Pendleton could
be guilty of robbery. And while the injured man
was confined to the house the Kenways and Neale
showed in every way they could their friendliness
for the Pendletons. Of course, Luke Shepard
had gone back to college and could have no part
in what the others tried to do for the unfortunate
family.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
All their thought was not given to this matter,
however. That dance at Carrie Poole’s loomed,
before Agnes at least, as one of the most important
things that had ever entered into her life.
Even Ruth put special importance upon the
affair, and that for more than one reason.
</p>
<p>
The Pooles had engaged a string band from
the city, a decorator from the same big town, and
a famous caterer. There would be invited guests
from Washington, including members of some
of the foreign embassies and their wives and
daughters. For Carrie Poole’s father during the
last eighteen months had served the district in
Washington as representative; and the family
was, as Agnes said, “cutting a wide swath.”
</p>
<p>
“But ’tis borne on my mind,” Mrs. McCall, the
Corner House housekeeper declared, “that them’s
not fittin’ frocks for a pair o’ young leddies to
wear on a cold winter night. Hech! They are
like gossamer, so they are.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, dear Mrs. Mac!” cried Agnes, “don’t
carp and criticize. Aren’t they pretty?” and she
pirouetted before the good matron to display her
own new dress.
</p>
<p>
“Pretty enough for the stage. But nae sensible,”
sniffed the housekeeper. “I’m astonished
at Ruth, so I am.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t!” gasped Agnes. “Don’t criticize
Ruth when for once in her life she is thinking
more of her good looks than of her good sense.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye’ve said muckle when ye say that,” sniffed
Mrs. MacCall. “There is nae guid sense in it.
And both of ye hoarse as crows with a cold.”
</p>
<p>
“Am not!” denied Agnes hastily.
</p>
<p>
She was hoarse, however, as was Ruth. Somehow,
the colds the two girls had caught in some
mysterious way, continued to cling to them.
Agnes was so afraid that her older, and usually
so much more sensible sister, would at the last
moment refuse to go to the party that she did
not know what to do. She confessed this to Neale
O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“If you ask me,” said the boy with more
gravity than he usually displayed, “I think you’d
both be sensible if you cut the party. I hate to
hear you hacking around like a dull meat-ax,
Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“How horrid!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
He grinned ruefully. “It threatens a bad
night. I’ll make you as warm as I can in the car.
But it isn’t like a limousine.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear,” sighed Agnes, the young elegant.
“I think we should have a closed car for winter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
If Ruth would only speak to Mr. Howbridge about
it——”
</p>
<p>
When the evening drew in and the time arrived
for them to start for the Poole house, Neale
O’Neil brought the car to the side door. Ruth
and Agnes appeared, bundled in their furs, but
of course, and especially on Agnes’ part, with a
plentiful display of the thinnest of silk hose above
dancing pumps.
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” whistled Neale, holding open the
tonneau door for the sisters. “The foolish virgins
certainly are in evidence to-night. It’s going
to snow and hail and sleet and everything else
mean, before we get home.”
</p>
<p>
“See that you put in the tire chains then,
Neale,” was all that Ruth vouchsafed him.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, already, she was secretly admitting
the folly of this venture.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—SOMEBODY PAYS THE FIDDLER</h2>
<p>
If Neale O’Neil was not a good prophet, he
certainly was a sure prophet, and Agnes Kenway
admitted it. When the time came to leave the
Poole party it did everything that the young
fellow had said it would. It was as nasty and as
cold a night as the two sisters ever remembered
being out in.
</p>
<p>
Worst of all, in spite of the antiskid chains
that Neale had spent a good hour from the party
in adjusting to the rear wheels, something else
went wrong, as he expressed it, and for fifteen
long minutes they were stalled on the wind-swept
Buckshot Road.
</p>
<p>
The icy fingers of that wind, if not the snow
and sleet itself, sought the girls out, through
every cranny of the automobile top. Ruth murmured
an admission that her sister was right.
They should have a closed car for winter.
</p>
<p>
By and by, when Neale managed to coax the
engine to start again, the girls were clinging together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
for warmth and their teeth were chattering.
Neale insisted on putting his robe about
them in addition to their own, and drove barelapped
himself for the rest of the journey.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall never went to bed when any of
the flock were out in the evening, especially on a
stormy night. On this night, Linda, the Finnish
girl, had fallen out of her chair asleep before the
kitchen stove and had been driven up to her room
in a sleep-walking trance by the good housekeeper
two hours before the arrival of Ruth and
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Tom Jonah, the faithful old watch dog, rose
yawning from his place behind the stove as the
girls stumbled into the kitchen. He went out
with Neale to see if it really was as bad a night
as it sounded.
</p>
<p>
“Ye puir bairns!” gasped Mrs. MacCall when
she saw them. “Ye’re blue with the cold and perished
of the snaw. Hech! Hech! What will Mr.
Howbridge say to this, I want to know?”
</p>
<p>
“You ask him, Mrs. Mac,” faintly said the
younger girl. “Oh!” and she began to cough.
</p>
<p>
“Hot drinks, Mrs. Mac, please,” said Ruth,
trying to speak cheerfully. “I fear we have been
very foolish. I fear we have.”
</p>
<p>
For once Mrs. MacCall did not scold when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
chances had been taken with her charges’ health.
In fact the housekeeper considered the matter too
serious. When she had hurried the sisters up to
their rooms, she proceeded to telephone to Dr.
Forsyth.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Forsyth had more than a practitioner’s
interest in the Corner House girls. He had been
treating Ruth and Agnes for their colds already.
And when he heard over the telephone that they
had been out into the country on this terrible
night, he declared his intention of coming right
over.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Forsyth had only turned away from his
telephone, shivering a little in his bathrobe at the
prospect of venturing out into the snow squalls,
when he heard a dog barking at his door and an
automobile horn tooting at the gate. He hurried
to peer through the glass beside the door, and
there saw the big head of Tom Jonah poked right
against the glass.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be right out, Neale!” shouted the doctor,
glad enough that he had not to go out to the
garage and tune up his own cold motor.
</p>
<p>
Neale had had the same thought Mrs. MacCall
had. He knew that Agnes, whom he loved so
dearly and with reason, and Ruth were both in
need of immediate attention by the medical man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
Dr. Forsyth got out as soon as he could, and
Neale drove him back to the Corner House and
waited there to take him home again.
</p>
<p>
When the doctor arrived the girls were in their
beds. Agnes was already in a fitful sleep; but
Ruth lay with wide-open eyes, burning up with
fever, with her usual domestic anxieties riding
her like a nightmare.
</p>
<p>
“Be sure and see that Tess wears her high
shoes if she goes to school to-day, Mrs. Mac,”
she murmured to the housekeeper. “Those others
that she likes so, leak in the snow and slush.
And Dot’s new gloves are in my sewing basket.
I had been tightening the buttons.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on!” commanded Dr. Forsyth. “Let’s
pay a little attention to Ruth instead of Tess and
Dot. How do you feel, my dear?”
</p>
<p>
“Like a Baltimore heater, thank you, Doctor,”
Ruth replied, in a saner tone. “Have I been very
crazy?”
</p>
<p>
“Very. Especially when you went to that party
last evening,” declared the medical man. “Now
be quiet—limbs and tongue! I’ve got to look you
over pretty thoroughly.”
</p>
<p>
“If there’s any—anything fun—funda—any
fun, doctor, I want to be in it!”
</p>
<p>
She really meant to say “fundamentally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
wrong” and that she wanted to know what it
was; but in truth Ruth Kenway was light-headed,
and it was some hours before she became her usually
sane self. Agnes was not so seriously ill,
but she was threatened, as Ruth was, with complications
which might have resulted in the
dreaded pneumonia.
</p>
<p>
“And I don’t want them to get the flu, either,”
growled Dr. Forsyth. “That’s going around, too.
Now, no school, remember, for the little ones!
Nor are they to leave the warm rooms of the
house—no playing in that ghost-haunted garret.”
That referred to an old joke that had haunted
the four Corner House girls when first they had
come to live in Milton. “And keep them away
from the sick ones. We do not know what may
develop.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goodness gracious!” gasped Agnes, who
chanced to hear this. “You don’t mean to say
I’ve got anything catching, Dr. Forsyth?”
</p>
<p>
“It wouldn’t surprise me, Miss Flyabout,” he
declared grimly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Agnes, and then began coughing
what Neale declared to be the real ‘Hark, from
the tomb’ cough. “Do I spray everything with
microbes when I cough like that?” she panted.
</p>
<p>
“With germs, perhaps.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then give me a veil. I must strain ’em,”
gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind straining them,” chuckled Dr.
Forsyth. “We’ll do the straining. You don’t
want to keep all those squirmy germs to yourself.
Cough and get rid of them.”
</p>
<p>
But although he could joke with Agnes (and
she would certainly have been in a very bad way
if she could not joke) the physician took extra
precautions that this serious cold should not
spread to the other members of the Corner House
household. He left medicine for all.
</p>
<p>
After Tess and Dot had taken their several
doses of medicine, they did not clamor to go to
school.
</p>
<p>
“I feel so mean that I guess I wouldn’t be any
good in school,” confessed Tess, and went to lie
down.
</p>
<p>
Dot struggled with her dose, and although they
both felt better the next morning, she could not
wholly forgive Dr. Forsyth for ordering such a
bad tasting draught.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo, Dorothy!” said the doctor jovially,
when he appeared on that next day to see how
his more important patients were getting on.
“What do you think of the medicine I gave you
yesterday?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t want to—to think of it at all, sir,”
stammered Dot. “I’m—I’m trying to forget it!”
</p>
<p>
Like Neale and the adult members of the household,
Mr. Howbridge became at once anxious
about Ruth and Agnes when he heard of their
illness. Even Agnes’ jokes could not hide the
fact that the two girls were in a serious condition.
</p>
<p>
“We lie here with only a wall separating us,
barking like two strange dogs on either side of a
picket fence,” said the flyaway sister. “How’s
Ruth now? Bark, dear, and let me hear you!”
</p>
<p>
But Dr. Forsyth forbade much conversation—especially
at the top of Agnes’ “barking voice,”
as she expressed it. Mr. Howbridge said gloomily
enough to the physician:
</p>
<p>
“I am really worried about those girls. I
thought they were enough of a charge when I
first assumed responsibility to the Court for them.
But now I am afraid that I may lose them.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing like that! Nothing like that!” exclaimed
Dr. Forsyth. “But I won’t say that conditions
are not serious. They may be housebound
for a good part of the winter.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say! And just when I was considering
very seriously getting into a more cheerful
climate, myself, for January and February. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
know, I begin to feel those two months in my
bones, Doctor.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” exclaimed Dr. Forsyth with interest.
“Going South, are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Say ‘were you?’” grumbled the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you can safely go when January comes,”
said the physician cheerfully. “The girls will be
in shape to travel by New Year’s, if there is no
set-back.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” demanded Mr. Howbridge, his
eyes opening.
</p>
<p>
“You did not consider going without the girls,
did you?”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly wasn’t considering going with
them!” exclaimed the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“Ahem? And why?”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Forsyth burst into laughter. “It will be
a breath of new life to Ruth and Agnes; and of
course they could not be contented without Tess
and Dot along.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait! Don’t say it all so fast,” groaned Mr.
Howbridge. “I have only just got rid of those
twins. Hedden and I have scarcely got our
breaths. And to travel with those four girls——”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t mind it,” chuckled Dr. Forsyth.
“You know you won’t.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“But how about Hedden? I believe he will give
me notice.”
</p>
<p>
However, the idea went with the lawyer, and
stayed with him. The holidays were approaching.
Although the two older Corner House girls
got out of their beds and were supposed to be
convalescent, they were weak. They just lay
around the house and were willing to be waited
upon. But Ruth did not forget the Pendletons and
was glad that Mr. Howbridge found work for the
man who had been injured.
</p>
<p>
Neale played games or read aloud with Agnes
by the hour. Sandyface, the old cat, came dragging
in her newest litter of kittens—all four of
them—and bedded them down in Ruth’s sewing
basket at that invalid’s feet.
</p>
<p>
“Aye,” declared Mrs. MacCall one day, standing
to look from one sister to the other, “it’s
somebody must always pay the fiddler. This time
you two lassies be payin’ tae the full!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—SAMMY PINKNEY’S DEVOTION</h2>
<p>
Of course Tess and Dot Kenway had gone
back to school after a few days. But while they
were housed up Sammy Pinkney learned something.
He scoffed at girls as playfellows quite
openly when he was in the company of the smaller
Corner House girls, but in secret he missed their
companionship sorely.
</p>
<p>
Living as he did, just catercornered across
Willow Street from the side door of the old Corner
House, Sammy had been the most familiar
playfellow of Tess and Dot since they had come to
Milton. Sammy’s affairs had always entertained
the Corner House family—even his attempts to
run away to be a pirate.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Tess and Dot did, Sammy had a
share in. During the brief time when they were
kept indoors because Ruth and Agnes were so ill,
Sammy concluded that he ought to do something
big for the little girls on the coming holiday.
</p>
<p>
“I got to give something nice to Tess and Dot,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
he told his mother and father. “They have done
a lot of things for me, haven’t they?”
</p>
<p>
“They are very good friends of yours,” agreed
his father.
</p>
<p>
“You could not have nicer playmates,” said
Mrs. Pinkney with satisfaction. “What do you
want to give Tess and Dot?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know yet,” answered Sammy thoughtfully.
“I want it to be something they’ll remember
me by after I get so big that I won’t want to
play with girls any more.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sammy!” exclaimed his mother, “I
hope that day will never come.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” growled her young son. “It’s bad for
boys to play with girls all the time. Makes ’em
sissies.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Pinkney was troubled; but her husband
laughed loudly.
</p>
<p>
“Let me pick out something sweet for the little
girls, Sammy,” said his mother, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, Mom? Candy?” asked
Sammy suspiciously. “They always have candy.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no. I mean something pretty—for them
to wear or look at.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” was the doubtful response. “They
don’t need any clothes. Do you mean pictures?
For they’ve got a lot of them. Their playroom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
walls are covered with ’em. Pictures printed on
the wall-paper. Don’t see much good in that myself.”
</p>
<p>
Again Mr. Pinkney expressed his amusement.
His wife, who was wholly without a sense of
humor or fun, frowned at her husband’s openly
expressed amusement. Moreover, she wished
that Sammy was less boisterous. And she blamed
Mr. Pinkney for encouraging Sammy’s ruder
tastes.
</p>
<p>
“He is getting old enough now to appreciate
better things,” she said in private to Mr. Pinkney.
“See how nice it is of him to think of giving
the little girls a nice present. I wonder what
he will decide upon.”
</p>
<p>
“You leave it to Sammy,” chuckled her husband.
“He’ll think of something that will surprise
them—and probably surprise you, too.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope it will be nice.”
</p>
<p>
“Remember,” said the man in warning, “that
it was Sammy who gave Tess and Dot that goat,
Billy Bumps. It’s been a cross to the rest of the
Corner House crowd, I have no doubt.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! Don’t suggest such a thing!”
gasped Mrs. Pinkney.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the suggestion Dr. Forsyth had
made to Mr. Howbridge regarding a winter trip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
South for the Corner House girls, bore fruit.
The lawyer had business at St. Sergius, the capital
of one of the island colonies in the Caribbean
Sea. St. Sergius was a commercial port of some
importance, and the business that called Mr.
Howbridge there was of moment.
</p>
<p>
He had intended to remain at a hotel there for
some weeks, and had even written for hotel booklets
and the like. Now he proposed to make the
trip a real outing, and he broached the matter to
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Guardy!” she sighed, “that sounds fine,”
and she began, Mrs. MacCall said, “to perk up
immediately.” Heretofore she had shown little
power of recovery from her illness—not as much
as Agnes showed. Now she became almost as
enthusiastic as her livelier sister over the proposed
journey into warmer climes.
</p>
<p>
Of course she wrote at once to Luke about it
and from him received the most amazing reply,
worded about like this:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 4em;'>
“Tell it not in Gath—nor in Pawtucket! I’ve
been as worried as a ball of knitting-wool in the
claws of a six-weeks’-old kitten! I had a chance
offered me, and I didn’t know what to do about
it. Believe me, the wind is tempered to the lawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
sham! Professor Keeps, who is a good friend of
mine, is going to spend some weeks in the Caribbean,
starting soon after New Year’s, and he
offered me the chance to go along—and get a salary
for so doing! Think of it! Luke Shepard is
to be assistant to a grave professor who is curious
about the botany of those tropic isles.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 4em;'>
“I am going to tell him now that I am his for
keeps! Pardon the pun. I will be there with
bells on, Ruthie. You can’t lose me. Maybe we
can sail in the same boat for St. Sergius. Tell
Mr. Howbridge to try to make the <em>Horridole</em> of
the Black Pennant Line. She is some boat. I
am coming down to see you before the start.
Package of remembrances starts with this letter
for Christmas. Hang ’em on the tree. I forbid
your peeping into yours, Ruthie, until Christmas
morning.”
</p>
<p>
Naturally this news could not be hidden. All
the household at once knew that Luke Shepard
would be able to spend some of the time, at least,
with the party which was to go to St. Sergius.
</p>
<p>
By this time, too, Tess and Dot, knowing that
they were to be included in the party, were telling
everybody they met of the good times in store for
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“Huh! You’d better stay home,” said Sammy
Pinkney disappointedly, for he knew that this
was a party which he could have no part in.
“There’ll be more going on here than down there
in the West Indies. You wait and see!”
</p>
<p>
“But they won’t be the same things,” declared
Tess. “We know all about the things that happen
in Milton in winter.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know everything,” said the boy,
wagging his head.
</p>
<p>
“What’s going to happen here, Sammy?” cried
Dot. “Oh! Do tell us.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re going to get a present.”
</p>
<p>
“We always get presents,” said Tess.
</p>
<p>
“What sort of present?” demanded Dot.
“Something for my Alice-doll?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be a great one!” said Sammy.
“I’m going to give it to you. Mike Donlan——Well,
never mind! You’re going to be surprised.”
</p>
<p>
“I like to be surprised,” confessed Dot.
</p>
<p>
“You will be,” said Sammy, nodding vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we are not going until after Christmas,”
said Tess, with sudden memory. “So it will be
all right.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
“But if I give you this present you ought to
stay home and look out for it,” declared their
boy friend.
</p>
<p>
“It must be alive,” said Tess thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
At that, Sammy, much afraid that he might
“give it away,” departed in haste. He could
not be confident of his own ability to dodge any
cross-examination of Tess Kenway’s.
</p>
<p>
Christmas Eve came at last. For the first time
she could remember Ruth went to bed without
putting the last touches to the Christmas tree in
the big dining-room. But she really was not equal
to it. So Mrs. MacCall did all that, aided by
Linda and old Uncle Rufus.
</p>
<p>
As usual the toys and games for the little folks
were numberless. And nobody was forgotten.
Sammy Pinkney, however, had come to Uncle
Rufus early in the evening and begged him to
leave the side door of the Corner House unlocked
when the family had got through dressing the
tree.
</p>
<p>
“What yo’ got in your haid, boy?” Uncle Rufus
demanded.
</p>
<p>
“’Tain’t in my head. It’s in our woodshed,”
confessed Sammy. “But don’t you tell nobody,
Uncle Rufus.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell what I don’t know,” admitted the
old colored man, who always entered into the
spirit of the children’s plays.
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be a surprise for everybody,”
declared Sammy. “You leave the door unlocked,
Uncle Rufus, and you’ll all know what it is in the
morning.”
</p>
<p>
And it certainly was a surprise! Sammy Pinkney
was famous for surprising people.
</p>
<p>
Everybody had at last gone to bed in the big
house—Linda and Uncle Rufus on the third floor,
and Mrs. McCall and the rest of the family in
their several rooms on the second. Midnight had
some time passed when everybody was awakened—but
that gradually—by a tintinnabulation of
silvery bells.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” gasped Dot, from her little bed,
to Tess, in hers. It was a wonder that the littlest
Corner House girl woke up at all, for she was
usually a very sound sleeper. But her head was
full of Santa Claus on this night. “Is that reindeer
bells, Tess?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Then they are inside the house, and I don’t
believe they could come down our chimney, big
as it is,” declared Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Sammy Pinkney came down it once—you remember?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
“But he doesn’t ring like bells,” was the very
practical reply.
</p>
<p>
Even Aunt Sarah Maltby heard the bells. She
poked her head out of her room door in her nightcap
and demanded:
</p>
<p>
“What’s all that? Those are the bells on the
Christmas tree. What does it mean, Mrs. MacCall?”
</p>
<p>
The housekeeper was already up. She came
out into the hall and sent the little folks back to
bed.
</p>
<p>
“Whatever it is, human or sperrit, I’ll be goin’
by myself tae see,” she declared. “The night
before Christmas is no time for you bairns to be
out of your beds.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose it is Saint Nick?” asked Dot,
in an awed tone.
</p>
<p>
“It may be,” said the housekeeper, descending
the front stairs. “And if it is, he doesn’t want
to see you. Go back to bed as I tell ye.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—INTO TROPIC CLIMES</h2>
<p>
The tinkle of the bells on the Christmas tree
was silvery in tone, and there was nothing about
the sound to frighten even Dot. But it was mysterious,
and Mrs. MacCall approached the door
of the dining-room with some hesitation.
</p>
<p>
She had only recently left the room with the arrangements
completed for Christmas morning
when the youngsters should first run down to
look at the present-laden tree, and exclaim in
“Ohs!” and “Ahs!” at the sight.
</p>
<p>
She could imagine nothing that would cause the
tree to sway and thus make the silvery bells
tinkle. There was no window open which would
create a draft and so wag the branches back and
forth. What could be the cause of the bells’
ringing?
</p>
<p>
She turned the knob of the door and pushed it
open a tiny bit. There was no light in the room,
although the tree was strung with electric bulbs
of rainbow hues. Instead of an open fireplace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
now, as there once had been, there was a gas log
under the old mantelpiece. But this was turned
off. The steam-heating plant in the cellar
warmed the house sufficiently and the logs were
used only in the fall and spring before and after
Uncle Rufus and Neale started the heater.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall’s finger searched for the button
on the wall just inside the door which would light
all the lamps in the room. And just then she
heard a muffled thumping sound, and the bells
all rang again!
</p>
<p>
“Slosh!” ejaculated the housekeeper. “’Tis
ghosties, sure enough!”
</p>
<p>
She did not mean that, of course. She was
just puzzled. But she knew, in spite of the darkness,
that there was something moving under the
Christmas tree where the rug had been turned
back for the framework, which held the tree, to
stand.
</p>
<p>
“Who is it?” demanded Aunt Sarah from
above.
</p>
<p>
“I’m nae so sure ’tis not Sammy Pinkney,”
grumbled the housekeeper. “He’s always up to
something. To be sure! I was right,” she
added, for now she had pressed the electric light
button and the whole room was ablaze with light.
</p>
<p>
The thing under the tree jumped again and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
bells once more jingled. The housekeeper
stepped forward in wonder. Was it another big
cat? Or—or——
</p>
<p>
“For the land’s sake!” gasped Mrs. MacCall.
“I knew I was right. Nobody but that dratted
Sammy would have brought in a rabbit and tied
it to that tree. And there’s a Christmas card
tied to the creature’s neck.”
</p>
<p>
She had to laugh, however. It was not a cat,
but a big Belgian hare—the biggest Mike Donlan
had in his pen. And the price of it had simply
wiped out Sammy’s bank account!
</p>
<p>
He had scrawled on a mistletoe bepictured card
the following:
</p>
<p style='text-align:center'>
“Fore Tes and Dot, from there fathefull
frend S. P.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall had not the heart to say anything
about it when she went upstairs again, after having
confined the Belgian hare in the sink closet
in the kitchen, out of which he was not likely to
gnaw his way before morning. The “Christmas
bells” had ceased ringing, and so the two little
girls went back to sleep without learning of their
unexpected present until the proper time.
</p>
<p>
But a lot of fun was had over that gift of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
Sammy’s. Neale and Uncle Rufus made a
proper pen for the Belgian hare in one end of
the goat shed where Billy Bumps chewed his cud
in lonely glory.
</p>
<p>
“Billy won’t eat him up, and maybe the two
will become good friends,” said Neale.
</p>
<p>
“What won’t that boy think of next?” gasped
Agnes, weak from laughter.
</p>
<p>
What Mrs. Pinkney said about it when she
learned the nature of her son’s “nice present”
to Tess and Dot, was plenty! And how Sammy’s
father laughed!
</p>
<p>
“I can’t understand,” said the worried Mrs.
Pinkney, “how that boy comes to do such ridiculous
things. I know I never had such ideas when
I was a child and I don’t believe you did.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I never did,” her husband chuckled. “I
own up that Sammy has inventive traits—and
others—that he does not come by, by heredity.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, Mom!” said Sammy thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, you strange boy?” sighed his
mother.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you have a chance to see me before I
was born?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! No,” gasped Mrs. Pinkney.
</p>
<p>
“Then I guess you must have ‘bought a pig in
a poke’ and that’s something Mrs. MacCall says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
is awful silly to do. You ought to have been
more careful when you was picking out a boy to
last.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, Christmas was a great day in and
about the old Corner House. Although the
older girls could not, as usual, visit their tenants
in a poor part of the town and take them presents,
Neale drove the little girls over there in the
automobile and Mrs. Kranz, the “delicatessen
lady,” and the girls’ very good friend, undertook
to distribute the gifts to the needy.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Rufus’s daughter, Petunia Blossom, and
her large family, came in for a generous share of
the good will that spilled out of the Corner
House.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil’s good friend, Mr. Con Murphy,
the cobbler, with whom the boy still lived, was
not forgotten, and included in his list of presents
was a fine green ribbon which Neale soberly
produced and proceeded to tie around the fat
neck of the perennial pig that occupied a clean
sty in Mr. Murphy’s back yard. For the old cobbler
was always very fond of “the gintleman that
pays the rint,” which was his name for the pig.
</p>
<p>
Agnes tried to be as merry as her condition
would allow. And on Christmas afternoon her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
school friends came in, and they had a little
party.
</p>
<p>
“Aggie is managing to inject considerable pep
into these proceedings, in spite of her lack of
strength,” Neale remarked to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The news that the Corner House girls were
going South for two months or so, was now general
knowledge; so the young folks when they
departed bade the Kenways good-by. It was
positive that Agnes’ face grew longer and longer
during this proceeding, and when they had all
gone she suddenly looked at Neale, gulped,
grabbed him by both shoulders and shook him a
bit, sobbing:
</p>
<p>
“You horrid boy! How can you be so cheerful,
Neale O’Neil, when I’m go-going so—so far
away?”
</p>
<p>
“Crackey, Aggie!” he exclaimed, “I thought
you wanted to go!”
</p>
<p>
“I—I do! But Ruth is going to have Luke
along, while you—you——”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on, Aggie! Don’t turn on the sprinkler,”
he begged. “I’d thought of that. You
bet I have been thinking about it every minute.
And—and——Oh, you wait!”
</p>
<p>
He dashed away, and she did not see him again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
during Christmas day. But Mr. Howbridge was
surprised to receive a visit from Neale O’Neil,
whose affairs were in his care while Mr. O’Neil
was in Alaska.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter now, Neale?” asked the
old bachelor guardian. “What’s gone wrong?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing, sir. Nothing yet, I mean. But
something is bound to go wrong if you and those
girls go off to the West Indies without making a
provision that you have not thought of.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes? Is that so? I thought I had arranged
for almost everything. Will you please tell me
what you have discovered missing in the arrangements
Hedden and I have made?” and the lawyer
smiled grimly.
</p>
<p>
“First of all, I want you to look at that report,
Mr. Howbridge,” said Neale respectfully, handing
Mr. Howbridge a report from the principal
of his school.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! Yes! I had already observed it.
And I must say, Neale, that your standing does
you credit.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir,” the young fellow said, glowing
at this praise. “And I am away ahead in my
classes. I can keep up all right if I chance to be
out of school for a few weeks. I can show
you——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s this? What’s this?” demanded the
lawyer.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir, that’s just what I mean!” cried
Neale O’Neil, rushing on. “I have just got to
go with you all, Mr. Howbridge. I couldn’t bear
to be left behind. And—and Agnes couldn’t
bear it either.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah-ha!” cried the lawyer. “Sits the wind
in that quarter? Then that is the explanation
of the note I got this very day from our surprising
Sister Agnes.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” demanded Neale, amazed.
</p>
<p>
“She says here,” Mr. Howbridge said, reading
the note which was written in Agnes’ unmistakable
hand, but rather shakily, “that she
thinks she doesn’t want to go with the party, but
would rather go back to school and catch up with
her class. And she needs the voyage just as
much as Ruth does.”
</p>
<p>
“The blessed kid!” exploded Neale O’Neil, his
face very red.
</p>
<p>
“Quite so, Neale,” said the lawyer soberly, and
laying a hand upon the boy’s sleeve. “That is
exactly what our Agnes is—‘a blessed kid.’
Don’t forget it. She is an impulsive, loving,
<em>blessed</em> girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” gulped Neale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never forget it,” repeated Mr. Howbridge.
“But I want to tell you that I had already favorably
considered taking you along. I think I can
make use of you down there. Goodness! I can’t
be expected to look out for four girls without
any help at all, can I?”
</p>
<p>
This matter being satisfactorily settled, there
was nothing left to do but to pack their trunks
and otherwise prepare for the voyage into tropic
climes, as Agnes, having suddenly recovered all
her gayety, expressed it.
</p>
<p>
The new year came in with an old-fashioned
snowstorm and Agnes and Ruth began to cough
again. Mr. Howbridge looked grave, but Dr.
Forsyth prophesied that the coughs would wear
off as soon as the afflicted girls got into the belt
of steady, warm weather.
</p>
<p>
On the third of January they started. Mrs.
MacCall was red-eyed and Linda was really not
fit to be seen! Old Uncle Rufus was as mournful
as could be, but tried to show some cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>
Sammy, having observed certain weddings in
the neighborhood, tied a number of old shoes on
the back of the automobile for luck and was restrained
with difficulty from throwing rice all
over the Corner House girls as they left home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge had taken Luke Shepard’s advice,
and had booked passage on the steamship
<em>Horridole</em> from the port of Boston. Luke met
them with Professor Keeps and his outfit at the
dock. It was a gay party indeed that went
aboard and sought their reservations among the
best staterooms on the boat.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me!” sighed Agnes ecstatically, and
now quite her pleasure-loving self, “it is so nice
to be wealthy. If we should ever be poor again,
Ruth, I know I should be the hatefulest thing in
skirts.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Aggie! Don’t talk that way.”
</p>
<p>
“It is the truth,” said the flyaway sister.
“Nothing poor or mean can ever satisfy me
again. I sometimes think I shall have to marry
a millionaire, or else I shall make my husband
very miserable.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t have to worry about that yet,”
laughed Ruth, but she flushed very prettily and
looked at Luke, who was out of earshot.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—LOTS OF FUN</h2>
<p>
There was one matter which had troubled
Ruth, and her friends, as well, before they left
Milton and the old Corner House. Even her illness
could not entirely turn Ruth’s mind from
the sad case of the Pendletons.
</p>
<p>
While she had been so ill she could not visit the
little family on Plane Street which seemed to
have been so sorely stricken. But she knew that
Mr. Pendleton had got up and was about, after
a fortnight or so, and that Mr. Howbridge had
found him a job. Dr. Forsyth told Ruth that
with proper care the man would suffer no serious
results from his fall in the chestnut woods.
</p>
<p>
At Christmas the family, especially the three
children, was lavishly remembered by the Kenways.
Margaret Ortwell Pendleton did not go
to the same school as Tess and Dot, so the little
Corner House girls did not see much of her, but
they heard about the Pendleton children—especially
of “Shot” Pendleton—quite frequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
through Sammy. Sammy was a rover, and he
kept in touch with the acquaintances which he
made to a remarkable degree.
</p>
<p>
But it was through her guardian that Ruth
Kenway learned more about Oscar Pendleton and
his troubles and learned what was going on in
the investigation into the robbery at the warehouse
of Kolbeck &amp; Roods. Mr. Howbridge had
become interested in the case.
</p>
<p>
“My clerk has not really raked up anything
satisfactory about that affair,” the lawyer reflected,
as he sat with Ruth on the deck of the
<em>Horridole</em> the second day out from port. “He
has got Pendleton’s story from him and—my
clerk, I mean—believes the man is innocent. It
is not a mere opinion; he gains his judgments
through logical reflection.
</p>
<p>
“But there is no evidence to the contrary that
would be accepted by any court. You see, Kolbeck
and Roods are not sure enough themselves
to have Pendleton arrested. That makes it very
bad——”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Guardy! I think that makes it very
good. Consider how poor Mrs. Pendleton would
feel if her husband was taken off to jail.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t see very far, Ruth,” said the lawyer.
“If he was arrested we’d bail him out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
hurry the trial, and make Kolbeck and Roods
try to prove their allegation. They couldn’t do
so and the man would be discharged and his name
practically cleared. We have no ‘Scotch verdicts’
in America.”
</p>
<p>
“What is a Scotch verdict, Guardian?”
</p>
<p>
“It is a custom in some courts of that country,
when guilt is not assured, to render a verdict of
‘not proven’; but it does not clear the victim’s
reputation. It is neither guilt nor acquittal.
But if Kolbeck and Roods could not bring forward
convincing proof of Oscar Pendleton’s
guilt, he would be acquitted.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! And can’t your clerk dig up any facts
on the other side—that Mr. Pendleton could not
have committed the robbery?”
</p>
<p>
“That is the job I have left him to do,” said
Mr. Howbridge. “He tells me the man who
saved Pendleton from arrest in the first place is
Israel Stumpf.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Israel Stumpf’? Let me see—haven’t I
heard that name before?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps. I understand he is Mr. Kolbeck’s
stepson.”
</p>
<p>
“That is it!” cried Ruth. “Miss Titus spoke
of him. And—and somehow I drew from what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
she said that Israel Stumpf was not a friend to
Mr. Pendleton.”
</p>
<p>
“My clerk says he is the boy who saved Pendleton
from immediate arrest.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Saved</em> him?” quoted Ruth. “Don’t you
mean that he balked the intention of the firm to
arrest the suspect and have the matter cleared up
at once?”
</p>
<p>
“You split hairs like any lawyer,” laughed
Mr. Howbridge. Yet he stared at the girl
thoughtfully for a long minute. Then: “I see
your point. I am going to wireless my office a
message. Perhaps a closer examination into the
life and works of Israel Stumpf might prove important.”
</p>
<p>
The little folks were, of course, immensely interested
in the sending of that message, although
they did not know its purport. Tess and Dot
wandered about the decks of the steamship in
their furs, Dot with the Alice-doll hugged close
to her breast, and stared at everything they saw
new; and, in Dot’s case at least, asked innumerable
questions.
</p>
<p>
When the <em>Horridole</em> got out into the Gulf
Stream where the air and sea were both warmer—much
warmer than at Boston—the two little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
girls began to enjoy themselves enormously.
They did not have to bundle up so much and the
sea-air was delightful.
</p>
<p>
Its effect upon Ruth and Agnes was equally
efficacious. They soon stopped the “Hark,
from the tomb a mournful sound!” as Neale
had called their separate coughs. Ruth was soon
able to walk about. Already Agnes, leaning on
Neale’s arm at first, paced the upper deck,
around and around, “to get an appetite,” she
said.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t do it, Aggie,” begged Neale O’Neil,
after watching her at dinner the second day.
“Remember what devastation you are causing.
This is a rich steamship line; but profits won’t
stand many such passengers as you are proving
to be.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it!” cried his friend delightedly.
“One would never think I had been eating at
home, but would believe I had been saving up for
this occasion. Do ask the steward for some more
tongue, Neale. I’m ashamed to.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Every part strengthens a part,’” said
Neale, quoting Mrs. MacCall. “I don’t know
about that tongue, Aggie. You weren’t behind
the door when they were giving tongues out.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so!” and she tossed her head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, still,” he added, his eyes twinkling,
“this is the tongue that never gossiped, so perhaps
it won’t hurt you to have a little more,” and
he summoned the waiter.
</p>
<p>
“I like your impudence!” Agnes exclaimed.
“Do you think I am in training to occupy Miss
Titus’ exalted position when I get to be her
age?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know. Can’t tell. You are getting
kind of dried up and ancient, Aggie. I’m worried
about you,” teased the boy.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not worried about you,” said she, tossing
her head again. “I know just how you are going
to turn out, Neale O’Neil.”
</p>
<p>
“How?” he inquired curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Bad.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m bound to be a bad man, am I?”
</p>
<p>
“You are. You are a tease, and you’re careless,
and you don’t care what happens when you
are out for fun, and you are reckless with your
money, and—and——”
</p>
<p>
“So far,” interposed Ruth who had heard this,
and she said it rather soberly, “you have related
your own shortcomings to a nicety, Agnes.
There is little use in the pot calling the kettle
black.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! I declare! Isn’t it the result of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
association with this boy that my own character
is so bad?” Agnes demanded.
</p>
<p>
“You are both incorrigible,” declared Ruth,
and thereafter paid no attention to them.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was feeling so much better by this time
that she was ready for any gayety and almost
any stroke of mischief. She was about with
Neale O’Neil all the time; and usually the little
ones were in their company. So that Mr. Howbridge
had not to fret himself in the least regarding
Tess and Dot.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Luke were together most of the time,
for aboard ship Professor Keeps did not need
his young assistant. Ruth thought the bald-headed
professor with the very pronounced near-sighted
squint, rather an interesting man. He
was still in the thirties; but he was so dry of
speech and look that it was difficult not to think
of him as much older.
</p>
<p>
He was interesting to talk with—or, rather, to
listen to. Luke said what Professor Keeps did
not know about botany, the flowers of the field
themselves had forgotten!
</p>
<p>
“You speak almost as uproariously as Neale
does,” said Ruth, smiling. “I never knew you
to be so hilarious before, Luke—not since I have
known you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why shouldn’t I be light-hearted?” he returned,
smiling. “This is my first regular job.
Of course, I worked at that hotel for part of last
summer, and so showed Neighbor that I really
mean to be self-supporting just as soon as I can
be. But being a hotel clerk did not rise out of
my college work.
</p>
<p>
“This is something different. Neighbor is
just as pleased as Cecile and Aunt Lorena. I
don’t suppose I shall be a professor of botany;
but this experience will help, and while I am
helping Professor Keeps I’ll be getting full
credit in my regular course. Shan’t have much
tutoring to do to catch up.”
</p>
<p>
“It is certainly nice that you can be with us,”
sighed Ruth happily. “I wish Cecile might have
come.”
</p>
<p>
“Aunt Lorena needs her. And whisper! I believe
Cecile has a new interest near home.”
</p>
<p>
“No!” ejaculated Ruth, her eyes shining.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am! Cecile has a ‘gemplum friend.’
And he’s an all right fellow—‘Gene Barrows.
He has a garage, and a business, and red hair.
And he is going to make a good thing of all
three,” chuckled Luke.
</p>
<p>
Agnes, as she regained her strength, regained
her volubility and charm as well. She was a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
pretty girl, and in spite of her youth she always
attracted attention from both young and old.
She was especially popular with the men and
boys of the passenger list.
</p>
<p>
She showed preference for none of them, however,
save Neale O’Neil, yet some of the girls of
her own age aboard began, before long, to consider
that the blond Kenway girl gathered altogether
too many of the boys about her. The boys
gathered about Neale, too, but the envious ones
would not see that. In fact, having set their futile
traps for Neale and failed to snare him, they
were all the angrier with helpless Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that girl who stares at me so hard
whenever she passes, Neale?” Agnes asked languidly,
as she lolled in her steamer chair on the
third morning out of Boston. “Have I seen her
somewhere before, or do I owe her money?”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, my child!” urged Neale, grinning.
“You know not of whom you speak in so careless
a manner.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she somebody?” asked Agnes, with increased
interest.
</p>
<p>
“She is. Her father is one of the high muck-a-mucks
of the Black Pennant Line—owns oodles
of stock. And she is from the coldest stratum
of Back Bay society—pos-i-tive-ly.”

<span class='caption'>“Who is that girl who stares at me so hard<br/>whenever she passes?”, Agnes asked.</span>
</div>
<p>
“Really, Neale?” demanded Agnes. “The
real people? What’s her name?”
</p>
<p>
“Nalbro Hastings.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! Not those Hastings?” exclaimed
Agnes, but lowering her voice and sitting
up to look after the girl in question.
</p>
<p>
“She is the real goods,” said the slangy Neale,
his eyes twinkling in amusement over Agnes’ excitement.
“John Y. Hastings is her male par-y-ent.”
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” whispered Agnes. “She is going to
turn around.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I bet the earth stops whirling on its
axis, and the moon follows Miss Hastings’ course.
She is going to play hob with the next tide.”
</p>
<p>
“Do be still!” commanded Agnes, worriedly.
“I had no idea she was Miss Hastings. And how
I looked at her!”
</p>
<p>
Neale coughed behind his hand. “You looked
at her just now as though you felt yourself to be
quite as good as she is. Have you had a change
of heart, Aggie?”
</p>
<p>
“Do behave!” commanded Agnes again, and
now she was really angry. “I had no idea! If
she gives me another chance——”
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help!” crowed Neale. “Ath-thith-tance,
pleathe!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t be common, Neale O’Neil!”
hissed Agnes angrily, prettier than usual when
her cheeks flamed so.
</p>
<p>
She smiled very winningly and looked straight
into Nalbro Hastings’ eyes as the latter came
down the deck again. The daughter of the Back
Bay millionaire was not unattractive herself.
And she was dressed in the very best of taste.
But she was not a person to gain unbounded admiration.
</p>
<p>
She looked coolly at Agnes in return. She
must have noticed the change in the Kenway
girl’s expression since she had passed her and
Neale before. As Agnes smiled and bowed Nalbro
Hastings returned the greeting with the very
faintest of nods and walked on immediately as
though having no desire to improve shipboard
acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
Neale began to shiver and his teeth chattered.
Agnes stared at him sternly.
</p>
<p>
“I believe if you would behave, Neale O’Neil,
I’d get on better in the world,” she sighed. “I
believe you were laughing when Miss Hastings
went by. Well, now, listen! I am going to get
acquainted with her. Maybe she will go to the
St. Sergius Arms where Mr. Howbridge has got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
reservations for us. It is the most fashionable
hotel on the island.”
</p>
<p>
“Do I have to put on full dress for dinner at
night?” demanded Neale, not at all pleased.
</p>
<p>
“You do,” said Agnes wickedly. “And I shall
insist upon your going to the manicure every
other day.”
</p>
<p>
“Ow! Ow!” groaned Neale. “Lucky I don’t
have to frequent the barber shop as Luke does.
I suppose you would then insist upon facial massage,
my lady?”
</p>
<p>
“Be still!” commanded the girl half in laughter
and half serious. “I mean to become very
snug with Nalbro Hastings, now you see.”
</p>
<p>
“I can see you’ve got a crush on her,” grumbled
Neale, “just because you think she’s of the
smart set. I wish you wouldn’t get these fits,
Agnes. You are such a jolly good sport otherwise.”
</p>
<p>
At that Agnes Kenway took real offense and
would not speak to him again for half an hour.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—THE GIRL FROM THE BACK BAY</h2>
<p>
Neale O’Neil tried to keep his eye on Tess and
Dot, as he had promised Mr. Howbridge and
Ruth, and he succeeded pretty well in doing so.
But the children made their own friends very
soon, and when Neale saw them conversing with
some of the passengers, or making inquiries of
the men working about the deck, he felt sure that
they really could be in no mischief.
</p>
<p>
Just what they talked about, and all the wonderful
things they learned of ships and shipgoing,
they found little time to tell the other girls
or Neale and Luke. But from a certain deeply
tanned and quizzically smiling deckhand, whom
they first met polishing brasses, Tess and Dot
gained a deal of what Dot insisted upon calling
“inflammation” about various things.
</p>
<p>
Some of this knowledge “spilled over,” as
Neale said, at the cabin concert, without which
no pleasant steamship voyage would be complete.
Agnes saw that “Nalbro Hastings” was written
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
at the head of the list of patronesses of this concert,
and she sighed bitterly because her name or
Ruth’s was not there at all. The charity for
which the concert was held was worthy, and Ruth
said that was enough. But it was not enough
for her social-striving sister.
</p>
<p>
However, to plan for a concert and for its
object was one thing; to find talent to offer a
fairly interesting program, was another.
</p>
<p>
“And that stuck-up Nalbro Hastings will never
get anybody to work for her in this show,” declared
one girl to the equally outspoken
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Is she really stuck-up?” queried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“When I asked her a question just now she
only mumbled and turned away,” declared the
critical girl. “She’ll spoil the whole thing.”
</p>
<p>
“We won’t let her,” Ruth said quietly. “If
they have used her name as patroness because
her father is a big man, as they say he is, in the
steamship company, it is not her fault. You know,
she may be bashful.”
</p>
<p>
“Bashful!” exclaimed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“And you see her name in all the Boston
papers,” gasped the other girl. “She is just
stuck-up.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had no opportunity of speaking to Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
Hastings herself. The daughter of the shipowner
did not eat in the cabin with the other first-class
passengers. The very fact that she had her
meals served to her in her stateroom seemed to
support the idea that had got about pretty generally,
that Nalbro Hastings was a very snobbish
girl.
</p>
<p>
“I hope that idea will not serve to ruin the
concert,” Ruth said more than once.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know where she expects to find her
talent,” sniffed Agnes. Then, twinkling: “She
hasn’t asked me to sing or dance.”
</p>
<p>
“I know a couple of stokers who do a regular
double-shuffle,” said Neale. “Caught ’em at it
on one of the ventilators, below. Say! No stage
dancer ever turned ’em off better.”
</p>
<p>
“Stokers! Grimy coal-passers?” sniffed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Why wouldn’t it be a good thing—and a novel
thing, too—to get the talent for this concert from
the steerage, stokehole, and forecastle? Usually
the concert is given by the cabin passengers and
the workmen aboard listen out on the edges of
the crowd. Why not let the poor fellows give the
concert and then everybody in the first and second
cabins can be asked to pay a round sum for
tickets.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
Agnes said not a word, but Neale threw up his
hat.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to ask those fellows——”
</p>
<p>
“No, no!” cried Ruth. “You have no right
to do anything of the kind. The suggestion should
be made to Miss Hastings.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess nobody will dare do that,” said
Agnes, and settled back into her chair with more
satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
Neale went off at once, however, without saying
another word to the sisters. He had noticed Nalbro
Hastings leaning against the rail, forward.
He marched up to her and pulled off his cap.
Miss Hastings looked rather startled and Neale
wondered if she was bashful, as Ruth had suggested.
</p>
<p>
“Beg pardon, Miss Hastings,” said the boy,
quite untroubled himself, “have you got all the
talent you need for the concert?”
</p>
<p>
The young girl (she was not far from Agnes’
age, after all) stared at him. Her lips moved,
but at first no sound came forth. She really looked
scared.
</p>
<p>
“For if you haven’t,” Neale O’Neil went on
to say, “I’ve found a couple of fellows who might
help out. If you are going to have sort of a vaudeville
entertainment, I mean.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“Would—would that be thuitable, do you thuppoth?”
lisped Nalbro Hastings. “I couldn’t
imagine what thort of conthert would be exthpected,
don’t you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my aunt!” thought Neale. “She lisps.
Wow!”
</p>
<p>
Aloud he said, keeping a perfectly straight
face: “Who have you got already and what do
they do?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I haven’t done a thing,” admitted Miss
Hastings, in evident desperation.
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” whistled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know what to do,” she added. “I—I
can’t talk to people, Mithter—er——”
</p>
<p>
“My name’s Neale O’Neil. I’m with the Kenways
and Mr. Howbridge.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, with that pretty, pretty Agneth Kenway?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell her that!” commanded Neale.
“She is proud enough already. And she has a
deadly crush on you, Miss Hastings.”
</p>
<p>
“On me?” Miss Hastings smiled; then, as her
upper lip began to lift she grew suddenly sober
again. “And—and I can’t talk to her—or to any
one!” she groaned.
</p>
<p>
“But you are talking all right,” said Neale,
amazed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you made me. And I have to pick my
wordth. Oh! Don’t you thee!” wailed the girl
from the Back Bay. “My—my—oh, dear me, my
teeth——”
</p>
<p>
“Lost ’em?” asked Neale, with quick sympathy.
“But you can get more.” Then he grinned suddenly.
“Mr. Howbridge has an extra set; maybe
he would lend them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Miss Hastings. Then she actually
laughed, and in laughing she showed a little
red gap in her upper front teeth.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t!” she begged. “I know you are
funny. You have thuch good timeth with that
Mith Kenway. But pleathe don’t make me laugh.
I had a dreadful acthident latht fall. Wath
thrown from my horthe in the Fenway. The
dental thurgeon promithed to have the plate ready
before the <em>Horridole</em> thailed. But it didn’t come
to the dock. Now I have thent a wireleth meththage——Oh!
Ithn’t it terrible?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a shame,” agreed Neale, but with dancing
eyes. “And can’t you have a concert because
of that?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I thertainly can’t take part in one,”
she said rather tartly.
</p>
<p>
“You’d bring down the house if you did,” giggled
Neale O’Neil. “But never mind. I’ll help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
you. Have you talked with the other members of
the committee?”
</p>
<p>
“Not very much,” admitted Miss Hastings. “I—I’ve
had to talk with my handkerthief in front
of my mouth and I am not thure that they know
what I have thaid. Maybe they think I’ve got the
flu,” and she began to laugh, herself, now.
</p>
<p>
“That’s right! Cheer up,” said Neale, who
would be friendly with the most self-conscious or
bashful person in existence, and found that Miss
Hastings was pretty human after all.
</p>
<p>
He told her about his “Caruso” and the dancing
team from the stokehole. Nalbro Hastings
seized upon the originality of the idea which Ruth
Kenway had expressed.
</p>
<p>
“And there are two little girlth—Here they
come now,” said Miss Hastings. “I heard them
thinging—the cuteth little thingth.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, that’s Tess and Dot Kenway,” declared
Neale, in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Call them over, pleath,” commanded the Back
Bay girl. “Athk them to thing that thong about
‘Dooley.’”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a new one on me,” Neale declared,
beckoning to Tess and Dot. “What’s all this
about the new song you’ve learned?” he asked
the sisters, when they came near. “This is Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
Hastings, Tess and Dot. You want to know her.
She’s a nice girl, only she’s made a vow that she
won’t speak till she gets to St. Sergius and the
parcel post catches up to us.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mithter O’Neil!” murmured the Back
Bay girl.
</p>
<p>
“She speaks some,” said Tess curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hear the song—and where did you learn
it?” Neale said.
</p>
<p>
“Our friend, Mr. Billie Bowling, learned it us,”
said Dot, referring to the deckhand before mentioned.
“Do you really want to hear it?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” said Neale. “Is it good enough to
sing at a concert?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Tess scornfully. “I’d sing
it at a Sunday school concert.”
</p>
<p>
But after Neale heard it, and had recovered
from his paroxysm of laughter, he said breathlessly:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let Ruth hear of your singing that in
Sunday school. But it will be a knockout at this
cabin concert, Miss Hastings.”
</p>
<p>
“It will! It will,” agreed the Back Bay girl.
“You muthtn’t tell anybody about it, children.
You can rehearthe in my thtateroom. Oh! You
tell them, Mr. O’Neil.”
</p>
<p>
And Neale did that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
What made Agnes mad—and she admitted it to
any of the party who would listen—was the bold
way in which Neale did it! To think of his walking
right up to Nalbro Hastings and talking to
her as though she was—was—well! Just common
folks!
</p>
<p>
“She is,” growled Neale, at last getting rather
tired of Agnes’ complainings. “She doesn’t
claim to be any different from other people.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know!” was his friend’s scornful
remark. “And with her nose stuck up the way
it is?”
</p>
<p>
“Nature did that; she’s not to blame,” declared
Neale soberly.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed!”
</p>
<p>
“Come along, Aggie, and I’ll introduce you,”
chuckled Neale. “Although she did tell me she
didn’t want to meet anybody aboard ship.”
</p>
<p>
“The stuck-up thing!” For Agnes was as
angry now as the other girls who considered Nalbro
Hastings snobbish. “She never would have
spoken to you if you weren’t a very good-looking
boy, Neale O’Neil. And you fell right down before
her and adored.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I never!” gasped the boy, hotly.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you deny it. Her money, and everything——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
That settled it with Neale. He tramped away
in the heat of anger. And because of what Agnes
said, he took delight in keeping the secret of Nalbro
Hastings’ retirement to himself.
</p>
<p>
However, because it was her duty, Miss Hastings
met with the members of the concert committee—the
“patronesses,” and arranged the
program. Ruth’s suggestion, relayed through
Neale O’Neil, governed Miss Hastings in choosing
the talent. Sailors, stokers, engine-room
men, and stewards were examined for talent.
</p>
<p>
Nor did Miss Hastings forget Tess and Dot
Kenway. As Neale O’Neil said in his most vigorous
language, their song was bound to be “a
knockout.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—THE CONCERT</h2>
<p>
Of course, Neale O’Neil and Agnes Kenway
could not be “mad at” each other for long. But
they did frequently have spats, for both were hot-tempered
and willful.
</p>
<p>
The boy, however, was usually so good-natured
that he overlooked a lot that Agnes said to him
when she was ruffled. On this occasion, however,
he enjoyed keeping certain facts secret and letting
Agnes fuss and fume. And as Neale continued
to be Miss Hastings’ right-hand man in
the preparations for the concert, Agnes existed
in a state of suppressed fury.
</p>
<p>
The glorious weather the party enjoyed while
sailing southward made it difficult for Agnes to
hold to her grouch.
</p>
<p>
It was surprising, too, what a number of things
there were to see while the steamship ploughed
southward. One day a half-grown whale kept
pace with the <em>Horridole</em> for hours, just as though
he enjoyed racing with steam. One of the ship’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
officers had been on several whaling voyages as
a young man, and he related to the Kenways and
Neale some exciting experiences he had had when
chasing the great mammals.
</p>
<p>
A school of porpoises likewise gamboled about
the ship, sometimes ahead, sometimes following,
their changing colors bringing wondering cries to
the lips of Tess and Dot. Circling seabirds flew
high above them, for, after all, the route the
steamship followed to the West Indies was never
far from shore.
</p>
<p>
The evening before they expected to reach
St. Sergius was appointed for the concert. Great
secrecy had been maintained regarding the identity
of the entertainers secured for it. There was
part of an opera company going to St. Sergius
for the winter season, and that had been drawn
on for an augmented orchestra, the ship boasting
a pretty good string band in any event.
</p>
<p>
But besides this help from the second and first
cabin, nobody else had been asked to entertain
among the cabin passengers. Save, of course,
Tess and Dot Kenway. Ruth was a little anxious
as to what the little girls were going to do; but
knowing that they had committed to memory
many songs and recitations, she did not doubt
but that they would acquit themselves well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
Nalbro Hastings had taken a good deal of interest
in the charity entertainment; but when the
hour arrived for it she did not appear on the
platform to announce the numbers. To Agnes
Kenway’s expressed amazement Neale represented
Miss Hastings—and he was not even a
member of the committee!
</p>
<p>
Her boy friend, however, acquitted himself
nobly. Agnes was forced to admit it and she
was, secretly, pleased that this was so. But she
did her best not to show it.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there could not be much dignity attached
to any occasion in which Neale O’Neil
was active. He began “jollying” when he introduced
the first entertainer.
</p>
<p>
“We begin with Caruso Junior,” was his declaration
when he introduced the Italian coal-passer
to the company.
</p>
<p>
Somewhere Neale had found a dress suit for
the young Italian, and as it was several sizes too
big for the man’s slim figure it aided in the hilarity
of the number. For the high note of the
whole concert was comedy, and “Caruso Junior”
sang only topical songs in both Italian and a
brand of broken English that delighted the audience.
</p>
<p>
The two dancers who did “a brother act” were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
an oddity that pleased as well. If this concert
was different from the usual kind on shipboard,
it was all the more appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Even Tess’ and Dot’s friend, Bill Bowling, had
been literally “roped in” for a number. It
seemed that he had been something besides a
deckhand in his life; and his past experience in
roping cattle in the West enabled him to use a
lariat equal to any vaudeville entertainer.
</p>
<p>
About the middle of the program Neale came
forward with a solemn face and announced:
</p>
<p>
“The nicest little team of entertainers in captivity.
I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen,
you are going to have a treat when the Misses
Theresa and Dorothy Kenway sing their song.
It is one of their own choosing, they learned it
without professional assistance, and the sentiment
and depth of feeling expressed in the words
cannot be questioned. I bespeak for Theresa
and Dorothy your gravest attention.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that boy up to now?” murmured
Ruth, troubled.
</p>
<p>
Agnes glared at Neale as he came down from
the platform.
</p>
<p>
“He has got something up his sleeve,” she
said, almost angrily.
</p>
<p>
“Do you children know your piece?” demanded Ruth in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
a whisper, as Tess and Dot
started for the stage.
</p>
<p>
“Of course we do,” declared Tess haughtily.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Hastings says we sing it fine,” said Dot
eagerly, and trotted after her sister.
</p>
<p>
Facing an audience did not trouble Tess and
Dot in the least. They had once played in a real
play; and they had often sung and recited at
school concerts. They mounted to the platform
as the orchestra struck up a queer melody, and
together, and hand-in-hand, began the song Bill
Bowling had first taught them.
</p>
<p>
To the amazement of Ruth and the others it
was a real Irish “come-all-ye,” and although the
words might not have been altogether well-chosen,
they were funny. When the little girls
came to the chorus and, with appropriate gestures,
emphatically half recited and half sang it,
the audience burst into a roar of laughter that almost
drowned the children’s voices:
</p>

<p style='margin-left:2em;'>Tess (stamping):—“And what did Dooley do to him?”<br/>
Dot (stamping):—“He vowed he was not tr-u-ue to him!”<br/>
Tess (stamping):—“Did Dooley owe him money?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span><br/>
Together:—“No! (Pause.) He shtole McCarthy’s pants!”</p>

<p>
The serious air with which Tess and Dot rendered
these lines almost convulsed their own
family. Even Ruth was helpless, although for
a few moments she felt shocked. It was, after
all, just a funny song, made more funny by the
way it was rendered and the character of the
singers. Tess and Dot realized that they had
made a hit and sang the three verses with
gusto.
</p>
<p>
“That Neale O’Neil!” murmured Ruth, turning
to Mr. Howbridge for comfort.
</p>
<p>
But the lawyer was laughing so uproariously
that she saw she would get no sympathy from
him.
</p>
<p>
Agnes declared that it was “that Nalbro
Hastings’ fault.” But, if it was a fault, it was
something that everybody enjoyed to the utmost.
Neale’s statement that the song would be “a
knockout” was prophetic. Before the entertainment
concluded there was a general request that
the children sing “Dooley” again.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we are pretty popular,” said Tess,
confidently.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t we sing it right the first time, Tess?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
her little sister wanted to know. “Have we got
to do it all over again?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, go and do it over!” gasped Ruth. “It
can’t be helped now. But I’ll never let you prepare
for another entertainment without first finding
out what sort of song you mean to sing. To
think of it!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry, Ruth,” chuckled Luke. “It’s
great. Worth the five dollars I paid for my
ticket. Those two chicks are certainly the hit of
the evening.”
</p>
<p>
The incident served not only to make Tess and
Dot popular, but the other Kenway girls were
likewise much flattered by the first cabin passengers
after the entertainment. Agnes began
to preen herself a little. There were some very
nice people aboard the <em>Horridole</em>, and even if
Agnes considered herself shut out from knowing
Miss Hastings of the Back Bay, there were others
of social prominence whom it pleased the girl
to become acquainted with.
</p>
<p>
So they arrived at St. Sergius and went ashore
next day amid great gayety. The St. Sergius
Arms—a white and green building of Spanish
architecture—overlooked the city, which nestled
at the foot of the island cliffs. Yet the hotel was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
not too far from the bathing beaches and the
curio shops along the plaza.
</p>
<p>
The Kenway girls continued to be made much
of by their new friends, and in a couple of days
they were as much at home in this strange environment
as any of the tourists. For St. Sergius
was certainly a very different place from
any town the Corner House girls had ever before
visited.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t help thinking all the men I see going
past are millers,” declared Agnes. “All in
white, you know. Only their broad-brimmed
hats do not look like the caps millers wear.”
</p>
<p>
“The girls don’t look like milleresses,”
chuckled Neale. “All of them with some kind
of veil twisted about their hair——”
</p>
<p>
“The reboza,” said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe. Anyway, there are some of them
awfully pretty,” added Neale.
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me,” Agnes said with dignity,
“that you are becoming a regular connoisseur
in feminine loveliness. How is your friend, Nalbro
Hastings?”
</p>
<p>
“She’s a whole lot better than she has been
since she left Boston,” declared Neale cheerfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean by that?” asked Ruth,
while Agnes stared at him. “She has not been
ill.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll say she has!” declared Neale, broadly
smiling. “Almost dumb. Very sad case.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know what you mean, you horrid
fellow,” Agnes complained. “I know there
must be some joke about it, but I don’t understand.”
</p>
<p>
“Allow me,” Neale said, rising and bowing
very low to Agnes. “I have here an invitation
from Miss Hastings.” But the note he drew
from his pocket he presented to Ruth. “Verbally,
I am particularly to urge ‘that <em>pretty</em> Miss
Agnes’ to attend afternoon tea as a special favor
to Miss Hastings.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” ejaculated Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Ruth nodded, but seemed puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. That is what she asks—and very prettily.
That all of us, not forgetting Tess and Dot,
will come to her suite at five, with Luke and
Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, of all things!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you go?” Neale asked, just a little
worried now. He had carried the joke pretty
far, he thought.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have half a mind to refuse,” declared
Agnes. “What shall I wear, Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
Neale was relieved by this question. He
smiled engagingly.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t need to worry about what you
wear, Aggie. She’s an awfully good kind. And
she’s been wanting to know you all along. But—she
couldn’t talk.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe you,” said Agnes flatly.
</p>
<p>
“Neale says she had a vow,” remarked Tess
soberly. “And she did speak sort of funny to
me and Dot. But she’s nice.”
</p>
<p>
“She has nice candy,” observed the littlest
Corner House girl. “She gave us some when we
were rehearsing for the concert.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you will go—and be a good girl,”
said Ruth, when she and Agnes were alone.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I suppose I must,” sighed Agnes.
“But I tell you what it is, Ruthie, I don’t like
Neale O’Neil having secrets from me. And I
don’t want him to be too friendly with other girls—not
even when they are from the Back Bay and
their names are in the society columns.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—A SEA ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>
That afternoon tea-party in Miss Hastings’
suite was one of the nicest things that had ever
happened to Agnes Kenway. She had dreamed
of being entertained by a person like the Back
Bay girl, served tea and cakes from a tea-wagon
and by a French maid in beruffled cap and an
apron not much bigger than a special delivery
postage stamp!
</p>
<p>
Neale said that Agnes began to purr like a satisfied
kitten almost as soon as she had shaken
hands with the Back Bay girl. Once convinced
that she had not been intentionally slighted on
the boat (for Miss Hastings could tell of her
dental predicament now with honest laughter),
the beauty sister proved herself to be one of the
most attractive girls in the world.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve wanted to know you, Miss Agnes, and
Miss Kenway, ever since you came aboard the
<em>Horridole</em>,” Nalbro Hastings said, in a winning
way. “And I must thank you girls first of all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
for lending me Mr. O’Neil, who is a very efficient
aid in almost anything social, I fancy.”
</p>
<p>
“Easy on the Mister O’Neil stuff,” growled
Neale. “I’ve got a first name, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“We have trained him very well,” said Ruth
demurely, “save in language. He uses the most
atrocious slang.”
</p>
<p>
“But he’s a good worker,” admitted Agnes,
staring coolly at Neale. “We have brought him
up to be useful.”
</p>
<p>
“Good in the pinches,” muttered the much
maligned Neale, but grinning.
</p>
<p>
It was a jolly occasion in every particular.
Agnes perhaps had her eyes opened regarding
the manners of Back Bay society girls. Nalbro
Hastings was just as friendly and demure a girl
as the flyaway Kenway had ever met. The latter
continued somewhat subdued, herself.
</p>
<p>
During the next few days the Kenways saw a
good deal of Miss Hastings. They searched out
all the interesting parts of the old town together.
The settlement dated back to a time soon after
the coming of Columbus to the West Indies. It
was not so old as Nassau; but there was an old
fort at the harbor’s mouth; a monastery, grim
enough of appearance, that might be turned very
easily into a fortress overlooking the town; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
a nunnery of dazzling white outer walls, but glowing
with color inside, where the girls almost
wrecked their pocketbooks buying fancy work.
</p>
<p>
Luke had to attend Professor Keeps on his
first jaunt into the interior of the island, and was
gone a week. Meanwhile Mr. Howbridge had
several conferences with a business friend whose
grapefruit plantations dotted the island. It was
to see this man and arrange for the investment
of some of his loose capital in the States that
the lawyer from Milton had made this trip to
St. Sergius.
</p>
<p>
So Neale was left alone to “beau the girls
around.” He did his duty nobly, nor were all
the ventures he engineered too tame. There were
only twenty miles of auto road on the island;
and, although a few people had small cars, it was
no paradise for motorists. But the trails over
the hills and along the verge of the chalk cliffs
were wonderful.
</p>
<p>
The natives had bred small donkeys, or burros,
in the comfortable saddles of which the tourist
could observe nature, at sea and ashore, in an
agreeable way. The Corner House girls, often
with others, including Nalbro Hastings, and
under Neale’s protection, traveled miles by donkey-back
over the trails of St. Sergius.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
The trails were bordered by jungle, it was true;
but that was because a cleared spot in the jungle
would return to its primeval state in two
years. But little plantations dotted the ways—a
cabin, palms, a grapefruit orchard, and a tiny
vegetable garden, all over-run with naked babies
of all shades from deepest ebony to a saddle-color
tan.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how anybody can be so black as
the black ones are,” sighed Agnes. “And so
shiny. Their skin shines, and their teeth shine,
and their eyes shine. Even Uncle Rufus’ Petunia,
as black as she is, doesn’t glisten like these
darkies.”
</p>
<p>
All the adventures the Corner House girls had
were not on shore. There were both sail and
power boats in the bay for hire. Neale felt himself
able to handle a sailing craft, and they ventured
out in one. But he obeyed Mr. Howbridge’s
injunction and did not go beyond the
fort.
</p>
<p>
During this first week at the resort letters arrived
from Milton and one of them was of particular
interest to the girls and Neale O’Neil. It
was from Mrs. Oscar Pendleton and was addressed
to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The troubled woman said in part:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
“We have many things to be thankful for, and
are especially indebted to you, Miss Ruth, and
your sisters. Don’t think us ungrateful. But
it does seem too bad that Mr. Howbridge asked
my husband to work for Peter Conroy, and without
learning first how Peter felt about Mr. Pendleton’s
affairs. It seems he gave Mr. Pendleton
a job just because he felt himself obliged to do so.
He was under obligation, he said, to Mr. Howbridge.
He told Mr. Pendleton so.
</p>
<p>
“All the time he was watching him, and counting
the money in the cash-drawer over and over,
and not letting Mr. Pendleton wait on cash customers.
It was very embarrassing for Mr. Pendleton
and sometimes forced him to explain to
people who were quite strangers, his misfortune
in having to work for Peter.
</p>
<p>
“And finally Peter miscounted the sacks of potatoes
that were delivered to the store and came
right out and accused Mr. Pendleton of carrying
off a 180 pound bag of potatoes! He accepted
his dismissal before Peter found the miscounted
bag, and I told Mr. Pendleton he should not go
back to work for the old curmudgeon. I hope
you will say I was right, Miss Ruth, although it
does seem that as long as these accusations hang
over him we shall continue in straits.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
The letter was somewhat rambling; but it gave
the older girls the impression that Mrs. Pendleton
was dreadfully worried. And if her husband
was again out of work it was no wonder that she
was anxious.
</p>
<p>
“I know that old fellow who keeps the store on
Plane Street. He’s just as ill-tempered as Billy
Bumps,” declared Neale O’Neil. “I guess Mr.
Howbridge did not know Peter Conroy, or he
would not have sent Mr. Pendleton to work
there.”
</p>
<p>
This proved to be the case, as the lawyer admitted
when he returned to the hotel at the end
of the week.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry for Pendleton. I had a personal
interview with him before we left home and he
seemed patient and willing. I am waiting now
to hear from my clerk whom I instructed by wireless
to look up the personal character of Mr.
Israel Stumpf.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” murmured Ruth, in some trouble,
“I only felt a suspicion of him. I do not
really know anything about Mr. Kolbeck’s stepson.”
</p>
<p>
“No. Neither do I,” said Mr. Howbridge
dryly. “But I mean to.”
</p>
<p>
“I know Mr. Pendleton has been ill used,” declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
Agnes, with her usual energy. “And
Mrs. Pendleton is a dear.”
</p>
<p>
“Carrie and Margy are real nice,” said Tess,
who overheard the discussion. “I guess their
father must be, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Anyway, he is the only man we ever saw that
fell out of a tree,” Dot observed. “He’s real
int’resting, I think.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Agnes were very much worried, and
talked the matter over together before retiring.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure I don’t know what poor Mrs. Pendleton
is going to do if the money stops coming
in,” said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“It will certainly be a hardship for them,” answered
Agnes. “He hasn’t been at his job long
enough to have saved any money.”
</p>
<p>
“Saved money! Why, Agnes, they’re not out
of debt yet for what they owed to the butcher and
the grocer and a whole lot of other people!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and think of its being in the dead of winter,
too!” went on the sister, with a troubled
face. “I do hope they’ve coal and wood enough
in the house to keep warm.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and clothing too. Think of those children
going out in the bitter cold winter weather
only about half clad!”
</p>
<p>
Nothing at present could be done, however, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
any of them to help the Pendletons. Matters
would have to take their course. Mr. Howbridge
knew that his clerk would be informed of Oscar
Pendleton’s loss of employment and would take
steps to aid the family accordingly. But nothing
vital could be done for the Pendletons until
the truth about the robbery of the Kolbeck &amp;
Roods warehouse was discovered.
</p>
<p>
Luke came back with Professor Keeps from
their first expedition for the study of the flora
of the island. The botanist was delighted with
his discoveries, and he was intent upon classifying
and mounting his specimens during the next
few days, so his young assistant was excused
from attendance upon him.
</p>
<p>
The Kenway party planned a voyage around
the island, for Mr. Howbridge’s business friend
owned a large motor-boat and had put the craft
at the disposal of the party from the North.
</p>
<p>
Both Neale and Luke had some knowledge of
the management of a launch, and the Kenway
party got under way early one morning, provisioned
for a voyage of at least forty-eight hours.
That they took no native seaman along was a
misfortune rather than an oversight. The caretaker
of Señor Benno’s motor-launch had been
taken ill during the night and lay groaning in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
hammock unable to go with the “Americanos.”
</p>
<p>
“Shucks!” grumbled Neale, “we don’t need
him. He wouldn’t be much good anyway, like
enough.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose he would know the shoals and tides
better than we do,” said Luke.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got the newest chart,” declared Neale.
“And we will have a care in getting near the
islands. Now, don’t say anything to scare the
girls.”
</p>
<p>
“How will you scare them?” Luke wanted to
know. “Agnes will always take a chance, and
Ruth really isn’t much afraid of anything. As
for the kids——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then,” Neale added, grinning, “say
nothing to Mr. Howbridge or he will want to send
up to the hotel for Hedden. And Hedden, you
know, would want to serve afternoon tea at five,
even if we were wrecked on a desert island.”
</p>
<p>
They laughed over the possibilities of catastrophe,
without considering that anything may
happen upon a voyage like this, and in these tropical
but treacherous seas.
</p>
<p>
The day was gloriously fair, and the motor at
first acted as though charmed. The craft, named
<em>Isobel</em>, made the circuit of the island long before
evening. They had kept well off shore and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
then in sight of the string of pearl-like islets that
extended farther than they could see into the
southeast. Palm-fronded, edged with white ruffles
of water, and in the distance hazed in blue,
they made an entrancing picture.
</p>
<p>
“We must see them all,” Ruth declared.
“Doesn’t your chart tell you where there is a
cove, or bay, where we can spend the night in
safety, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course. And we can get there before
nightfall,” declared Neale.
</p>
<p>
“What do you say, Mr. Howbridge?” Ruth
asked their guardian.
</p>
<p>
“It seems quite safe to venture,” the lawyer
returned. “Is the engine acting all right, boys?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t see anything the matter with it,” replied
Luke.
</p>
<p>
But one can never prophesy regarding a motor-boat
engine.
</p>
<p>
St. Sergius was twenty-five miles behind them,
and the nearer of the chain of small islands was
not less than ten miles away, when the power
went wrong on the <em>Isobel</em>.
</p>
<p>
“That comes of blowing about how fine she
worked without knocking wood,” grumbled
Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Is it going to keep us long?” asked Agnes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
“What a ridiculous question that is!” rejoined
her friend. “Am I a prophet, or the son of a
prophet? What do you say, Luke?”
</p>
<p>
Luke had been scanning the horizon to westward.
He stepped down into the cockpit of the
<em>Isobel</em> with some haste.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you what I think about one thing,
Neale,” he whispered in the latter’s ear. “There
is going to be a change in the weather—and a big
change—within a very short time.”
</p>
<p>
“For the worse?” asked Neale, startled.
</p>
<p>
“It couldn’t be for the better,” replied Luke.
“We’ve had a perfect day; but the end of it is
going to be squally. And I’ve heard that even at
this time of year, which is not the hurricane season,
the weather in this part of the Caribbean can
be distinctly nasty.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—THE ISLAND REFUGE</h2>
<p>
Those streaks on the horizon foreboded evil
weather, as Luke had feared. None of the party
on the <em>Isobel</em> had ever seen a storm gather so
quickly. In an hour the waves were white-capped
and those blue streaks of wind had reached the
zenith.
</p>
<p>
Behind it, from the west, rolled up a pallid
hedge of mist, back of which the stronger wind
growled like a leashed dog. Lightning fluttered
across the face of the coming cloud-bank. Then
the crackle of thunder rose louder and louder.
</p>
<p>
Luke and Neale, even Mr. Howbridge, worked
at the stalled motor. They took turns whirling
the fly-wheel. There was no more response than
as though they had stood up and commanded the
tempest to recede.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the children did not understand
the threat of the elements. Tess and Dot were
not often affrighted by a thunderstorm. And Ruth
and Agnes could not wholly understand what was
coming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
There was not the usual hush which is so often
noted before the striking of such a tempest. In
this case the wind and lightning drew on with
equal velocity; but the rain stayed behind. On
and on the forefront of the storm came, as savagely
persistent as a pack of wolves, and then
leaped upon its prey with a force that seemed to
crush every object on the surface of the sea.
</p>
<p>
The only craft in sight was their own <em>Isobel</em>.
The waves flattened about her for a considerable
space, and for some moments, as though the wind
came from directly overhead.
</p>
<p>
“Get inside, every one of you girls!” commanded
Mr. Howbridge, shouting at the top of
his voice. “Close that cabin door and keep it
closed.”
</p>
<p>
The little ones were already below. Ruth went
down the steps, shouting back over her shoulder:
</p>
<p>
“You’d all better come too. You can do nothing
here.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes scuttled behind her, terrified indeed.
They jammed shut the slide. Almost the next
instant the thunder of the rain on the deck deafened
those in the cabin. The two boys and the
lawyer lay under a tarpaulin which shed a portion
of the deluge. But they could not distinguish
each other’s speech.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
It seemed as though the very weight of the
rain must sink the motor-boat. It thundered on
the deck and foamed in the cockpit. Such a cloudburst
none of them had ever seen, or even
dreamed of.
</p>
<p>
In ten minutes the rain passed. It roared on
toward the east like the rattle of a giant drum
corps. But the darkness and wind remained. It
was impossible to see more than a few yards
about the <em>Isobel</em>. Islands, and all, had disappeared.
But the launch was moving now—racing
into the east, like the rain, and with all the force
of the wind and sea astern.
</p>
<p>
Neale crawled out from under the tarpaulin
and climbed up on a cushion seat out of the knee-deep
water. That water was roaring out through
the vents, or seeping into the lower bilge. When
Luke got up he made straight for the pump and
began to work it. It sucked immediately, and the
water spurted through the hosepipe.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, boys!” shouted Mr. Howbridge,
“what are we going to do?”
</p>
<p>
“Keep our eyes open for an island,” shouted
back Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Hope we’ll find one,” was the muttered reply.
</p>
<p>
“Keep the old boat from sinking,” declared
Luke, vigorously pumping.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“The girls will be scared to death,” grumbled
the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
“Let them stay below and they won’t know
much about it,” Luke told him.
</p>
<p>
“Good idea,” tossed down Neale, as he staggered
upon the break of the cabin roof.
</p>
<p>
There came a knocking on the cabin door. It
was stuck.
</p>
<p>
“There! They want to get out already,” cried
Mr. Howbridge.
</p>
<p>
“‘Want to’ and ‘Can’ are two different
things,” replied Luke. “Let ’em knock!”
</p>
<p>
It was not that the boys were callous, but they
knew that if the girls came out of the cabin they
would immediately appreciate the full danger of
the situation. Agnes and Ruth would not be able
to see much through the narrow deadlights.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge went to the cabin slide. He
put his lips close to the door and shouted:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t bother! Stay where you are! We are
all right, but must wait for the wind to stop.”
</p>
<p>
“Let—us—out!” shrieked Agnes’ voice.
</p>
<p>
“Stay where you are and keep still!” commanded
their guardian more sternly. Then he
asked the boys, with no little anxiety: “Is it safe
to let them stay down there? Suppose she should
turn turtle?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’re riding pretty fair now,” said Luke.
</p>
<p>
“And if she turned over they would have a
better chance than we would,” declared Neale
O’Neil. “There would be air enough confined in
the cabin to keep them going for a time. But if
we were thrown into this sea there isn’t one of
us could live five minutes.”
</p>
<p>
This was so evidently the fact that Mr. Howbridge
said nothing more. The lawyer was not
much of an out-of-doors man at the best. He had
not spent much time on the sea or in the wilds,
and he was now past middle age. But he possessed
something that not all men used to roughing
it possess. He had a broad knowledge from
reading of boat-sailing as well as of other sports.
</p>
<p>
He was less ready to show apprehension than
the young fellows. The responsibility for this
condition of affairs must rest more on Mr. Howbridge’s
shoulders. The lawyer accepted this
fact, and proceeded to cudgel his brains to find
a way out of the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to overhaul that engine, in spite
of the heavy sea, and try to make her go,” Mr.
Howbridge said. “You’ve cleared out the water
pretty well, Luke. She rises to each wave, and
as long as it does not rain again we certainly will
not be swamped.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“We need a lantern,” complained Neale.
“Guess we’ll have to pry open that door, Mr.
Howbridge.”
</p>
<p>
“Think so? I don’t want the girls up here.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we can make the little ones stay down,
and Ruth will look out for them. If Aggie insists
on coming up here we’ll set her to work.”
</p>
<p>
“That will please her only too well,” said
Agnes’ guardian.
</p>
<p>
Which was true enough. Agnes rushed out on
deck, sputtering. Neither she nor Ruth had any
idea of the extent of the disaster. When she saw
the racing, foam-capped waves and the blackness
of sea and sky, even the flyaway was subdued.
</p>
<p>
“Are we headed in the right direction?” Ruth
asked at the open slide.
</p>
<p>
“We sure are,” grumbled Neale. “Heading
right with the wind. If we tried to shift our
course the wind would like enough roll us over
and over like a barrel.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it fortunate the wind is heading us
toward St. Sergius, then,” observed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, shoot!” ejaculated Neale. “Do you think
even the elements play in our favor, Aggie Kenway?
According to the needle of this compass
we are heading due east, and St. Sergius is some
distance behind us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Agnes and Ruth in unison.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Ruth,” said Mr. Howbridge sternly, “I
expect you girls to do your share. You look out
for the children in there. If Agnes insists on
being out here she can come and hold this pry-bar.
I believe we’ve got to block up the engine
at this corner before she will make an even stroke.
I could see that she jarred when we started, and
I should have insisted upon having her jacked up
then.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes came very meekly and did his bidding.
Neale stuck to the wheel, or the craft would have
wabbled much worse than she did. Luke aided
the lawyer at the cranky engine.
</p>
<p>
Ruth tried to be cheerful with Tess and Dot.
But both little girls had already gained the impression
that they were in danger. Tess asked
seriously:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you suppose, Ruthie, that it would be a
good thing if we said our prayers, even if it isn’t
bedtime?”
</p>
<p>
But Dot’s mind ran upon more mundane things.
She remarked after a little silence:
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if Sammy Pinkney was here, if he
would feel much like being a pirate on this wiggly
boat?”
</p>
<p>
As the storm continued to sweep the <em>Isobel</em> on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
and on, with no sign of abatement, the older ones
at least felt no desire to converse uselessly, and
the little girls went to sleep in a berth. Fortunately
they were not so seriously troubled by
the peril that menaced as their elders. Even
Agnes was subdued; but she, like Ruth, was courageous.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge finally gave up the attempt to
start the engine. While the launch pitched so it
was impossible to make any headway with the
crippled mechanism of the <em>Isobel</em>. They managed
to make some coffee, and with this and
crackers, they tried to satisfy their appetites.
Then they went to rest for the night. But nobody
slept much.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the force of the wind, a certain
current must have seized the boat, for she drove
on for hours in a direction quite opposite to that
in which the party wished to go. St. Sergius and
any inhabited island they knew anything about
were behind them.
</p>
<p>
With dawn the wind fell, the sea became calmer,
and the clouds began to break. The first rays of
the sun, when flung into their faces, did not dazzle
their eyes so much that they could not observe an
isle almost dead ahead. A cheerful green island
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
it was with a hill in its center on which grew a
very tall palm.
</p>
<p>
“We’re going to land there if it can be done,”
declared Mr. Howbridge. “There are two long
oars and you boys do what you can with them
when we get close in.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, Captain,” cried Neale cheerfully.
“Looks as if we were going to play Robinson
Crusoe for a while, doesn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“More like the Swiss Family Robinson,” Luke
remarked. “Looks like a deserted place, doesn’t
it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see any hotel,” rejoined the lawyer
dryly. “But there is quiet water in that cove
yonder. See if you can paddle us into it.”
</p>
<p>
At any rate, the strange island offered a refuge.
And a bit of solid earth under their feet was what
they all most craved.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—A LONG WAY FROM THE CORNER HOUSE</h2>
<p>
An hour after sunrise the keel of the <em>Isobel</em>
scraped upon the sands of the shallow cove which
indented the western shore of this unknown island
that was to be the refuge of the Corner House
girls and their friends.
</p>
<p>
There was still a wide stretch of calm water
between the prow of the motor-boat and the low-water
mark. The boys could force the craft no
nearer land with their oars.
</p>
<p>
“How do we land?” Agnes demanded. “We
can’t fly. And this water looks as though it were
waist deep.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, for a bathing suit!” murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Neale had quickly retired to the cabin while
the other members of the party were discussing
the difficulty that confronted them. Luke had sat
down to pull off his shoes and stockings and prepare
to wade ashore, when the younger youth reappeared.
</p>
<p>
“I declare!” exclaimed Agnes. “He has got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
his bathing suit. How did you ever think to bring
it, Neale O’Neil?”
</p>
<p>
“Never know when it may rain,” chuckled her
friend. “Now I’m going to drop over the bow,
and I’ll take you ashore first, Aggie, if you want
me to.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about that,” objected Agnes.
“We don’t know what may be lurking in that jungle.
The hill around the foot of that big palm is
clear, I know. But that thicket between us and
the hill——”
</p>
<p>
“What do you think will hurt you?” Luke demanded.
“There are no wild animals in these
islands. Not even snakes, I am told.”
</p>
<p>
“Just the same, I’ll wait till you are ready to
carry Ruth, Luke,” said Agnes decidedly. “We
can wait together on the shore while you bring
over the children and Mr. Howbridge.”
</p>
<p>
“This is another case like the man who had to
cross the river with the goose, the fox, and the
bag of corn,” chuckled Neale. “But I guess we’ll
make it somehow. Come on, girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Here comes the goose!” cried Agnes, stepping
off the bow of the launch into Neale’s arms.
“Hurry up, Ruth. If there are savages in that
jungle I want you to be present at the first introduction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
Your manners are so much better than
mine.”
</p>
<p>
The transportation of the four girls did not
take long. Meanwhile Mr. Howbridge removed
his shoes and socks and came ashore carrying
some wraps and a few cooking utensils.
</p>
<p>
“We want breakfast first of all. I do not believe
we shall find here any natives, savage or
otherwise, who will offer us a meal,” the lawyer
said.
</p>
<p>
Neale had carried ashore the end of the painter
and they moored the motor-boat safely to a stub
driven into the sand above high-water mark. The
young fellows went about making a camp at the
edge of the jungle in a matter-of-fact way.
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t your chart tell what island this is?”
Ruth asked Neale O’Neil. “Surely it can’t be an
unknown island.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably not,” Mr. Howbridge said, smiling,
and before Neale could reply. “But it is safe
enough to say that it is unoccupied save by ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“And—and have we got to stay here?” gasped
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Until we can repair the motor-boat engine, or
some one appears to take us off,” said the lawyer
soberly. “But we have some provisions and I
can see that there is fruit growing in plenty yonder,
and this cove probably offers many shellfish,
and finny denizens of the sea as well.“

</div>
<p>
“That’s all right,” said Agnes, briskly recovering
from her momentary alarm. “But I never
care for fish for breakfast. What are you going
to cook over that fire, Neale O’Neil?”
</p>
<p>
“Give your order, lady. The chef will try to
fill it,” declared Neale, quite unshaken by the
prospect.
</p>
<p>
“Two eggs. I always have two eggs for breakfast,”
declared Agnes. “You can have all the
fruit you want to; but I demand the pair of hen-fruit,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, my lady,” Neale said, bowing.
“Keep your eye on this fire, Luke, while I go
egging.”
</p>
<p>
“Egging!” exclaimed Luke, quite as mystified
as the others.
</p>
<p>
“Sure. I’ve got to go to market for the eggs,
haven’t I?” said Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we go to the store with you, Neale?”
Tess asked eagerly. “Dot and I. We can help
you bring home the things.”
</p>
<p>
“You certainly can. Come on,” said Neale
cheerfully, and started off as confidently as
though he expected to find a butter and egg store
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
around the first corner. Ruth made no objection
to the little girls going, for she was assured by
their guardian that there was nothing on these
little islands that could possibly hurt them. The
three were soon out of sight, for the fringe of
low palms and shrubs edged the sands in both
directions, and probably continued right around
the circumference of the island.
</p>
<p>
“This is certainly a lonely island,” Ruth said
reflectively. “Don’t you suppose it has even a
name?”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s give it one,” announced Agnes, when
Luke had shaken a negative head to Ruth’s question.
“Why not? We’ll take possession of it
in the name of the U. S. A. Spain, or Holland,
or France, or England must have overlooked it,
or they would have named it.”
</p>
<p>
“And tacked up a shingle here with the name
on it—and a traffic arrow?” chuckled Luke.
“‘This is a one-way street’!”
</p>
<p>
“Smarty!” exclaimed Agnes, making him a
little face. “Can’t we name it, Guardy Howbridge?”
</p>
<p>
“With my full permission,” rejoined the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t know what to call it,” said Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
reflectively. “That big mound in the middle—with
the tree on it. A palm, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“We saw that palm just as soon as we saw anything
when the light broke this morning,” said
Luke.
</p>
<p>
“It is a landmark,” Mr. Howbridge added.
</p>
<p>
“That is just the thing!” exclaimed Agnes
briskly. “The big palm is the most prominent
thing about here. Call it Palm Island.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“I subscribe to that name,” said Luke.
</p>
<p>
So the refuge of the Corner House girls and
their friends came to be called Palm Island. That
Dot insisted upon calling it “plam” instead of
“palm” made little difference. She was always
mispronouncing new words.
</p>
<p>
Just at present, however, Dot and Tess and
Neale O’Neil did not know that the island had
been christened. They came back briskly from
around the point at about the time Luke got a
good fire to burning on the beach. The coffee
was on and Mr. Howbridge was boiling cereal
which had been aboard the motor-boat.
</p>
<p>
“Where are my eggs?” demanded Agnes,
shouting to the exploring trio just as soon as she
caught sight of them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil raised a bundle he held in his
hand. It was a big bandana handkerchief, knotted
together at the corners, and evidently containing
something heavy. The little girls were both
smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Eggs for every one,” said Neale cheerfully.
“Our hens laid very well this time. Here are
eighteen, and that should be enough for seven
people, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
“You never found eggs, Neale O’Neil!” cried
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he did! Yes, he did!” cried Dot, jumping
up and down with delight.
</p>
<p>
“And out of the funniest nest,” said Tess,
quite as excited.
</p>
<p>
Agnes and Ruth looked into the handkerchief
with some disbelief. They saw a dozen and a half
rather dirty looking eggs; at least, they were of
a brownish-gray color. The shells looked leathery
and not like the shells of hens’ eggs.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“You call those eggs?” demanded Agnes
doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“And all out of one nest,” cried Tess delightedly.
</p>
<p>
“Fancy!” said Ruth, much puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you know what you are doing, Neale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
O’Neil,” said Agnes. “Don’t poison us with
some strange fruit.”
</p>
<p>
“So they look like fruit to you, do they?”
snorted Neale.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take a chance,” said Luke, grinning, “if
there is a yolk and a white to them.”
</p>
<p>
“Put on the fry-pan with some oil in it. Get
me the pepper and salt. The chef proposes to
turn out some fried eggs to beat the band! How
do you like ’em—sunny-side up, or turned over?
State your preference, ladies and gentlemen.”
</p>
<p>
He used his knife to cut the “shells” of the
eggs; but the yolk of each was of a deep color
and it was quite evident that, no matter what kind
of eggs they were, they were fresh.
</p>
<p>
“Ought to be,” said Neale with confidence. “If
they were not laid last night during the storm,
they certainly were the night before.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand it,” said Agnes, as the
first relay of eggs began to sputter in the pan.
“Are there really poultry on this desert island?
What kind of hen lays such eggs?”
</p>
<p>
“A four-legged one,” declared Neil promptly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
Luke was chuckling again, for he had already
guessed the nature of the eggs. “And a hen with
no feathers, Neale?” he suggested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’ve said it,” rejoined the younger fellow.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh!” cried Ruth, suddenly laughing.
“And it has a shell.”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy! Four-legged—and featherless—and
a shell,” murmured the puzzled Agnes. “There
is one thing sure, we have no poultry to answer
to that description at the old Corner House.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, but we are a long way from the old Corner
House,” said Mr. Howbridge, likewise smiling.
“You must expect different fauna—as well
as different flora—in this part of the world.”
</p>
<p>
“And of course, we are bound to find many
wonderful things on Palm Island,” Ruth declared
soberly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—MANY NEW THINGS</h2>
<p>
After all, that was the gayest of gay breakfasts.
Tess and Dot did not appreciate the gravity
of the situation in any case; they were only
glad to be off “that pitchy boat,” as Tess proclaimed
it, and there was so much on the island
that was novel that the little girls could not fail
to be excited and interested every moment of the
time.
</p>
<p>
Besides, Tess and Dot were in Neale’s secret
of the eggs laid by the wonderful four-legged hen
without feathers. This description of the wonder
pleased the little folks very much.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see what you mean by all this mystery,”
declared Agnes, tasting her first fried egg
gingerly enough.
</p>
<p>
Then she ate it all down very quickly, for it
was now late in the morning, and she had been
hungry for her breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it all right?” demanded Neale.
</p>
<p>
“It tastes kind of—of fishy, I think,” said
Agnes. “But I don’t mind it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose,” said Luke gravely, “that if there
are hens here on the island they probably frequently
dine off the shellfish along the shore. So
that would explain the flavor of these eggs.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a trick somewhere,” sighed Agnes.
“But never mind. If these eggs are the work of
legerdemain, Neale, you can wave your wand
again. I’ll take another.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth and the others knew by this time, of
course, the nature of the eggs. But it was much
fun to keep up the joke as long as Agnes, who was
usually so bright, did not see through it. She
said to Neale:
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you take me to the hen-run and let me
see your flock of biddies? I know they must be
trick hens, and I’d like to see them.”
</p>
<p>
“Ahem!” murmured Neale thoughtfully.
“You want to look a gift egg in the mouth,
do you?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I want to look these hens in the beak,”
declared Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“And you can do that, by ginger!” crowed
Luke, suddenly falling over on the sand in a paroxysm
of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“‘Look ’em in the beak’ is good!” ejaculated
Neale. “Yes, you may do that, Aggie. But—let
me think——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t think if it is going to strain anything,”
said Agnes scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“There is only one time in the whole twenty-four
hours when you can be sure of doing that,”
continued Neale O’Neil, with perfect soberness.
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake!” exclaimed his girl
friend. “Now you are carrying the thing too far.
Only one hour in the twenty-four when the hen
that laid these eggs is to be seen?”
</p>
<p>
“You have put it pretty near right,” declared
Neale. “Isn’t that so, Mr. Howbridge?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe so, Neale. At about sunrise, isn’t
it?”
</p>
<p>
“Pretty near that,” agreed Neale. “I’ll wake
you up when the time comes and show them to
you, Agnes.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, they are some seabird—Oh, no!
That can’t be!” she cried. “For seabirds have
feathers.”
</p>
<p>
“You had better not undertake to strain your
mind, Aggie,” advised Neale. “Wait until the
proper time.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes tossed her head again at that and refused
to show any further interest in the mystery.
Besides, there was so much to do just as soon as
breakfast was over that they could not chatter
any more about the eggs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
The sky was fleckless by this time and it did
not seem possible that another storm could come
up. But remembering how quickly and unexpectedly
the tempest of the afternoon previous had
broken, Mr. Howbridge first of all considered it
wise to make provision for getting the motor-boat
into a more sheltered roadstead. The cove was
too open to the sea, and Neale, on his short exploring
trip, had noted a more sheltered place at
the eastern end of the island.
</p>
<p>
The boys and Mr. Howbridge waded out to the
boat again, pushed her keel out of the sand, and
proceeded to paddle the craft along the shore,
while the girls strolled along the strand, easily
keeping pace with the boat. They saw not a living
thing on the island save lizards and birds.
There was no sound from the jungle to affright
them. The strand itself was a field of wonderful
sea treasures, to be reaped as they pleased.
</p>
<p>
“It is a wonderful place,” Ruth declared. “I
am really glad we came.”
</p>
<p>
“If we don’t have to stay too long,” ventured
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I expect Mrs. MacCall and Aunt Sarah will
be pretty lonely without us,” remarked Tess.
</p>
<p>
“And Uncle Rufus and Linda,” said Dot, accepting the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
idea that they might never return to
civilization.
</p>
<p>
They really had so much to do and so much
fun doing it that it was little wonder if Tess and
Dot considered very lightly the semi-privations
the party suffered. What were proper beds, and
shelter, and restaurant-cooked food, compared
with the jolly makeshifts that were made necessary
by their present condition?
</p>
<p>
The camp was established back from the small
but sheltered inlet in which the <em>Isobel</em> was finally
anchored. The anchorage was so deep that a
fallen palm log made a gangplank from the rocky
shore to the deck of the motor-boat. By means of
this, everything was brought ashore that they
thought would be needful.
</p>
<p>
The boys brought tarpaulins and pieces of sailcloth,
and between four palm-stems in the middle
of the cocoanut grove some rods back from the
water, they proceeded to set up a shelter for the
girls to use as a bedroom. Of course, the living
and cooking in general would be done in the open,
and there were plenty of blankets for the boys
and Mr. Howbridge when they lay down to sleep
on the sand.
</p>
<p>
The grove showed some marks of the storm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
that had swept this part of the Caribbean so savagely
the day before. Although the cocoanuts
were in a green state, some had been wrenched
from the tops of the trees and flung about. The
soft meat of these nuts was already good to eat;
and there were bananas and mangoes—the latter
refreshing, but not much to the children’s taste
at first.
</p>
<p>
Neale poked out great lobsters in the crannies
of the rocks. There were crabs to be caught too.
Mussels, razor-shell clams and maninoses added
to the edible supplies. Besides these, the waters
about the island were crowded with fish of various
kinds. There was little need of the party going
hungry, although Dot did ask rather earnestly
for a piece of bread and butter.
</p>
<p>
Besides laying up such stores of provisions as
they might need for the next few meals, the party,
even Dot and Tess, walked clear around the
island, following the edge of the sea. It was a
long walk, but they took it in the cool of the day
and the little folks were not too greatly wearied
by the walk.
</p>
<p>
They were all, too, delighted with what they
saw. There were in some places great coral rocks
heaped up by the surf, and the girls had never
imagined that there could be so many varieties
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
of coral. Great, smooth, mother-of-pearl-lipped
shells were likewise gathered by the children.
</p>
<p>
There were ill-smelling masses of half-animal,
half-vegetable matter to which the Corner House
girls were inclined to give a wide berth. These,
too, had evidently been cast up on shore by the
recent storm. Luke poked at them, and then became
importantly scornful.
</p>
<p>
“You use these probably every time you take
a bath in your tub at home,” he announced. “And
because you see them in their natural state you
scoff at them.”
</p>
<p>
“Not me!” cried Agnes vigorously. “You’ve
got the wrong idea if you think I’d let a thing
like that into my bathtub. Whew!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t really understand, Luke,” said Ruth.
“Is it an animal?”
</p>
<p>
“Partly. It swims about at first and then adheres
to a rock. So then it grows into a vegetable.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” scoffed Agnes. “Then an oyster is
both animal and vegetable, for that is what it
does.”
</p>
<p>
“They are sponges, are they?” asked Mr. Howbridge.
“I never chanced to see one in its natural
state before.”
</p>
<p>
“Ho!” exclaimed Neale. “Me for the rubber
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
sponges you buy in the drug stores hereafter.
They are nasty, Luke.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t blame me,” chuckled the collegian.
“They don’t belong to me. And perhaps you
wouldn’t care for rubber if you could see it gathered
and know how it is prepared. But that,
like the sponge, goes through so many processes
before becoming commercially useful that we can
easily forget its natural state.”
</p>
<p>
They got back in time for supper. Somewhere
on the way Neale had slyly discovered some more
of the leathery-shelled eggs, and he produced
them triumphantly in an omelet; for Neale, after
his circus experience and other adventures out-of-doors,
was by no means a bad cook. They all
acclaimed his skill.
</p>
<p>
“But I do want to see your flock of funny
hens!” exclaimed Agnes. “You never used to
have secrets from me, Neale O’Neil. It began with
that Nalbro Hastings, the girl from the Back Bay.
I wonder what she would do if she were here!”
</p>
<p>
“Be eaten up with sand-fleas—as we are,”
murmured Ruth, scratching.
</p>
<p>
But the boys had laid a piece of sailcloth for
the floor of the girls’ tent; and when they went
to bed they were no longer annoyed by the sandhoppers.
Around the fire, after the Corner House
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
girls had retired, Mr. Howbridge and the two
young fellows talked very seriously indeed regarding
their situation here on Palm Island.
</p>
<p>
“I have an idea from studying your chart,
Neale, that we have been driven far off any steamship
course,” said the lawyer.
</p>
<p>
“That’s my idea, too, sir,” agreed Neale.
</p>
<p>
“As long as it remains pleasant and we have
enough to eat and drink, all is right enough. But
do you notice, boys, that the water barrel aboard
the launch is getting low?” said Mr. Howbridge.
</p>
<p>
“Crackey! I didn’t think of that,” muttered
Neale.
</p>
<p>
“I did. And I’ve been smelling about for a
spring. But I didn’t find any,” said Luke.
</p>
<p>
“And many of these coral islands don’t have
any fresh water save in the rainy season.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so. But—but, Mr. Howbridge, we’re
not sure that this is entirely a coral island,” Neale
said anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“There are coral reefs surrounding it, anyway,”
the lawyer observed.
</p>
<p>
“Those rocks where we have moored the launch
are not coral,” said Luke suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“You are right, my boy!” exclaimed Mr. Howbridge
more confidently. “There is a chance that
the island may be of volcanic formation, and be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
immensely old. As old as the big islands of the
West Indies. That being the case, we may easily
find water bubbling up from the subterranean
depths.”
</p>
<p>
“Hope so,” muttered Neale. “Thirst is an
awful thing, as the codfish said when he found
himself on dry land.”
</p>
<p>
Still, it was not a matter to joke upon. The
three followed the example of the girls and went
to sleep, fearing no enemy on this deserted island.
Neale O’Neil was astir very early, however. Indeed,
it was not yet light and a fog lay upon both
sea and shore. This gray pall made the place
seem so strange and uncanny that Neale could
not go to sleep again. Besides, he heard something!
</p>
<p>
He sat up and threw aside his blanket. There
was a shuffling step on the sands below the palm
grove. No, there were countless shuffling steps!
</p>
<p>
Amazed—not a little frightened for the moment—Neale
got lightly to his feet. He was about to
touch Luke and try to awaken him, when to his
mind came the simple explanation of the sound,
and he almost broke into loud laughter.
</p>
<p>
At second thought he stifled this desire to vent
his amusement and crept away from the camp to
the edge of the grove. The sliding, shuffling sound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
in the sand above highwater mark continued. He
could see absolutely nothing, for the light fog
plastered the shore like a mat.
</p>
<p>
Remembering something that he had promised
Agnes Kenway the day before, Neale went back
to the tent and scratched with his finger nail on
the canvas. He heard a movement in answer almost
at once, and spoke Agnes’ name.
</p>
<p>
“This is Ruth,” said the older sister. “What
do you want, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Agnes,” replied Neale, chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“What you punching me for, Ruthie?” asked
the sleepy voice of the flyaway sister.
</p>
<p>
“Neale wants you,” giggled Ruth. “He’s waking
up the whole camp to get you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Neale O’Neil!” gasped Agnes. “Do you
want me?”
</p>
<p>
“Come on,” whispered Neale. “I want to show
you my hens.”
</p>
<p>
At that statement Ruth began to laugh again,
but Agnes scrambled into her outer clothing,
greatly excited by what Neale had promised her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—ADVENTURES OF THE CASTAWAYS</h2>
<p>
“Now shush! And listen!” whispered Neale,
when he grabbed Agnes’ wrist just outside the
girls’ tent.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with you?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t keep still,” Neale warned her,
“you’ll miss seeing my flock of chickabiddies.”
</p>
<p>
“You are fooling, Neale O’Neil. You know you
are,” she murmured.
</p>
<p>
“You come on, and keep still,” he said, still
dragging her by the wrist. “Don’t even whisper.
The fog is rising slowly and the dawn will soon
appear. My flock is scary in the daylight——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, pshaw!” muttered Agnes. “You just
sound silly.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not as silly as a girl of your age must be
not even to imagine what kind of eggs those
were,” chuckled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“I knew there was a trick in it!”
</p>
<p>
“Shush!” he warned her again. “If you don’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
mind frightening my flock, don’t wake up everybody
else in the camp.”
</p>
<p>
She was silent when they came to the edge of
the palm grove. It was already growing light
over the sea, and the mass of fog that had covered
everything during the night was lifting and rolling
back upon itself. Something moved on the
sand not twenty feet from where the girl and boy
stood.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! What is that?” queried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Hear ’em?” said Neale. “That shuffling
sound? I bet there are a hundred of ’em on this
shore.”
</p>
<p>
“Neale O’Neil! What does it mean?” gasped
the girl, in wonder.
</p>
<p>
“It means that we are on one of the Tortugas.
We must be. And this desert strand is populous
at night, sure enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Turtles!” shrieked Agnes.
</p>
<p>
At once the sliding and shuffling noise increased.
The first beams of the sun coming up
out of the eastern ocean began to separate the
strands of mist. The boy and girl peered earnestly
out upon the open shore.
</p>
<p>
“There’s one!” gasped Agnes. “A big fellow!
Wish we could catch it to show to the children,
Neale.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
“I mean to catch it,” declared Neale, running
down from the cocoanut grove, a stick in his hand.
“And more than one.”
</p>
<p>
“Going to make it lay more eggs?” giggled
Agnes, keeping step with him.
</p>
<p>
“My dear girl! That is fresh meat for us. Fish
and clams are all right. But here is the nicest
kind of meat—better than chicken. And nourishing
fat. My flock not only will supply us with
eggs at this season of the year, but the turtle will
give us ragout and soup beyond compare.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, you talk like a French chef, Neale
O’Neil,” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Say rather like a hungry American boy who
wants variety. Ah! This is a monster, Aggie!”
</p>
<p>
They almost fell over a turtle which was bigger
around than the bottom of an ordinary tub. Neale
stuck his stick under it, heaved persistently, and
the struggling, hissing creature went over on its
back.
</p>
<p>
“Now look him in the beak,” laughed Neale.
“But keep away from his flippers. Those claws
are sharp.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” ejaculated the girl. “What do
you think! Here is another!”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll turn over a couple more. They can’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
very well get back on their stomachs and crawl
away. You see, they all beat it for the sea about
sunrise and go to feeding on kelp and the like
down on the rocky bottom. They come ashore to
lay their eggs—and—and visit together, I suppose,”
he added, rather confused in his mind regarding
the natural history of the sea-turtle.
</p>
<p>
Twice he pitched upon a scrambling turtle and
turned it over. The three were well above highwater
mark, so the sea could not roll in and aid
them to escape.
</p>
<p>
“And now,” pursued the boy, “let us hunt the
haymow for eggs for breakfast.”
</p>
<p>
“How ridiculous! What do you mean—‘haymow’?
Where do those funny things lay their
eggs?”
</p>
<p>
“Wait,” urged Neale O’Neil. “It is getting
lighter now, so we can see better. Look along the
sands up here near the jungle. If there is a sort
of round place patted down—not just smooth, but
hard—that may be a nest. The turtle scoops out
the nest with its fore-flippers, lays the eggs
smoothly in the saucer, and then covers back the
sand and beats it down with its flippers. Look!
There is a likely place!”
</p>
<p>
Agnes fell on her knees immediately and began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
to scratch away the sand. She came, not more
than two inches below the surface, to the huddle
of leathery-skinned eggs.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, Neale! How exciting this is. I
thought I should cry myself to sleep last night
because I was a Miss Crusoe. But I went to sleep
so fast that I forgot to cry. And now <em>this</em>! Why,
being cast away on a desert island is lots of fun,
I think.”
</p>
<p>
Later, the two smaller girls quite agreed with
Agnes on this point. But Ruth looked at the situation
more soberly.
</p>
<p>
When they were all up and had bathed their
faces at the edge of the water——
</p>
<p>
“But I feel sticky!” Tess observed, after her
ablutions were performed. “I might just as well
have not washed my face. And if there isn’t anything
but salt water here on this island, shall we
have to drink only coffee and tea?”
</p>
<p>
“I’d rather have milk,” said Dot thoughtfully.
“I guess if Neale found hens here he can find
cows, too,” and she laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I can find milk,” declared Neale
O’Neil promptly. “And don’t worry about the
salt water for washing your face, Tess. It is very
good for your eyes, sea-water is.”
</p>
<p>
Luke looked sideways at Ruth and muttered:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“Some boy, that Neale. He’d be cheerful at
the bottom of a well.”
</p>
<p>
“We must admit Neale O’Neil is a very good
person to have along if one is to be cast away on
an uninhabited island,” said the critical sister,
smiling. “But where, do you suppose, will he
find the milk?”
</p>
<p>
They had forgotten the cocoanuts. Neale got
a gimlet and bored the “eyes” of a big one and
the milk foamed out into the children’s cups.
They rather liked its sweetish flavor too.
</p>
<p>
“Although,” said Dot, “I think my milk’s been
skimmed. It looks sort of blue.”
</p>
<p>
In the stores which they had brought ashore
from the launch there was some canned milk; but
they were sparing of this. The older members of
the party refused to use it at all in their drink.
There was considerable coffee and tea and some
canned fruits and meat. They had not expected
to be gone from the St. Sergius Arms much longer
than two days, and had provisioned accordingly.
</p>
<p>
But Neale’s bright mind evolved makeshifts
for food as well as for other things. He entered
into the spirit of this Crusoe experience with all
the gusto of live adventure. It would have seemed
very tame indeed to him, on this uninhabited
island, if his ingenuity had not to be taxed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge warmly acclaimed Neale’s statement
that the capture of the sea-turtles was important.
After breakfast, which was graced by
the turtle eggs which Agnes had helped discover,
the whole party gathered about the three sprawling
turtles, which the lawyer called “testudinate
reptiles.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t call them by such horrid names, Guardy,
or I shall not want to eat them,” begged Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“And who is going to do the preparing?” Luke
wanted to know. “How do you get them out of
their shells, Neale? That looks like a formidable
task.”
</p>
<p>
“You can read poetry to them, if you like,”
grinned Neale, “till they get disgusted and shuck
their shells to get away. Or you can tickle their
toes with a straw until they laugh so heartily that
they split their shells.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Neale!” exclaimed Ruth, while the others
laughed with and at him.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. Give me the boat-ax,” said the
joking boy. “I don’t need any help. We will
have stewed turtle for dinner if you leave it
to me.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge and Luke immediately went
aboard the <em>Isobel</em> and began a thorough overhauling
of the engine. They had tools in plenty;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
and now that the motor-boat was in quiet water
they thought they would be able to correct the
mechanical difficulties. Luke knew considerable
about an engine, and the lawyer was not unhandy
himself.
</p>
<p>
Ashore, the bigger girls proceeded to make the
tent more comfortable, so that if they <em>should</em> be
obliged to stay another night it would be better
for the children. There were certain pans and
dishes to wash, and washing them in salt water
was not an easy matter.
</p>
<p>
Nobody had said much about the small amount
of drinking water; but Ruth had thought of it
and she forbade Agnes to use any of the supply
that had been brought ashore unless she was actually
obliged to. If Tess and Dot said anything
about being thirsty, Ruth gave them fruit, the
juice of which made up for the lack of water which
they would have drunk under other circumstances.
</p>
<p>
As for Tess and Dot, when they had sated their
curiosity in looking at the three turtles on their
backs with their flippers waving in the air, they
wandered away on a tour of exploration, the
smaller sister bearing her Alice-doll, which was
almost as much her companion as her own head.
</p>
<p>
The two little girls wandered afar that morning. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
others were so sure that Tess and Dot
could not get into trouble that they did not limit
the bounds of their wanderings, so long as they
kept to the easterly side of the mound on which
grew the great palm tree.
</p>
<p>
The island was not more than an eighth of a
mile wide at this end, and the shrubbery in the
middle, between the two strips of shore, was not
properly a “jungle,” for it was easily penetrated
even by Tess and Dot Kenway.
</p>
<p>
Dot, however, was not as sturdy as her sister.
Nor was she so much interested in the strange
things they saw. In fact, Dot was a very practical
little thing, and nothing, no matter what,
suited her unless it was just what she was used
to in and about the old Corner House.
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t these shells pretty?” cried Tess, gathering
pearl-lipped shells on the strand and loading
her apron with them.
</p>
<p>
“We have shells at home,” said Dot, in her
blasé way. “Mrs. MacCall’s got one as big as
that for a sugar scoop.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Well! So she has,” admitted Tess.
“But maybe she’d like a new one.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” asked the exasperating Dot.
“They never wear out, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
The sun began to get hot and there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
longer a breeze. Even Tess considered the shade
of the dwarf palms preferable to the open beach.
Dot, nursing her Alice-doll, sat down on a stone
as soon as Tess called a halt, and emitted a sigh
of relief.
</p>
<p>
“Well, anyway!” she remarked. “I’m glad
you want to wait a while, Tess Kenway. You
know, we don’t have to see everything on this
island in one day.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we have,” rejoined her sister quickly.
“If Mr. Howbridge and the boys get the engine
fixed, we’ll go right back to the hotel. Ruth says
so. I need a clean pair of stockings.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, my Alice-doll ought to have her clothes
changed,” admitted Dot. “I guess we’ll not have
to stay here much longer. Or maybe a steamship
will come for us. I——”
</p>
<p>
And then, with sudden animation, she began
waving her arms and feet and from her lips issued
the most excruciating cries. She lost hold of the
doll, which sprawled in the sands. To Tess Kenway’s
amazement, Dot began to travel right away
from the edge of the grove toward the sea!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—MR. METHUSELAH</h2>
<p>
Dot’s cries of surprise and Tess’ shrieks for
help brought Neale bounding through the grove
with the older girls after him in wild alarm. What
they saw first was calculated to amaze them.
</p>
<p>
Cavorting down the beach was Dot Kenway,
flat upon her back, her legs and arms waving
wildly. She was not moving so very fast, but she
evidently was headed for the sea.
</p>
<p>
Luckily Neale had picked up the first weapon
to his hand when he started. This was the stick
he had used early that morning to turn over the
three captured turtles. He ploughed his way
through the brush, leaped across the sands, and
arrived beside the traveling Dot just as she rolled
off the shell of the huge turtle which, half-buried
in the sand, she had thought was a stone!
</p>
<p>
Neale immediately inserted the stick under the
edge of the creature’s lower shell and heaved it
over on its back. Dot gathered herself up, crying
and sputtering.
</p>
<p>
“You—you can have your old turkles, Neale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
O’Neil!” she cried. “I won’t even eat their eggs,
if that’s the way they act. I—I thought I was
sitting down on a stone. I—I——”
</p>
<p>
Ruth arrived to comfort her. Meanwhile Tess
brought the Alice-doll and Neale and Agnes examined
this huge reptile, which really was a monster.
</p>
<p>
“He must be awfully old,” said Agnes, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“The edge of his upper shell is all cracked and
dented. He’s seen some few seasons, all right,”
Neale agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Do they grow very old, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Old as Methuselah,” laughed Neale.
</p>
<p>
“No!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a fact. Tortoises—sea turtles, too—grow
to be hundreds of years old. They beat elephants
and whales. This fellow——”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll get away if you turn him over,” Agnes
cried.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll head him up the beach. I want to see——”
</p>
<p>
Over went the big turtle at that moment. Neale
jumped on the corrugated shell and tried to hold
the creature down. The sand slid from the shell
and as the dull beast started to crawl up the
strand, instead of into the sea, Agnes came nearer
and pointed at something she saw.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“See there, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Look out! Don’t get in front of him!” Neale
warned her. “His beak is as hard as iron.”
</p>
<p>
“Are those letters, Neale—words?” demanded
Agnes, still staring at the turtle.
</p>
<p>
Neale rolled off, scrambled to his feet, and began
to examine the marks on the turtle’s back.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right they are!” he exclaimed. “We
aren’t the first folks that have made a pet of this
fellow.”
</p>
<p>
“Pet!” repeated Ruth, scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“What does it say?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he carries his calling card with him,”
announced Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
Dot stopped crying and Tess and she came
nearer to the turtle. The creature, as though
realizing that it was foiled in its first attempt to
reach the sea, had stopped. They could all see
the deep scratches on the shell. They looked like
this:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CRISTOFO&nbsp;COLUMBO<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1492<br />
</p>
<p>
“Well, of all things!” gasped Ruth, when she
had gained a complete understanding of what the
inscription on the turtle’s shell meant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is that his name?” asked Dot. “Cristuff—tuff——Why!
And there is his number!”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if that is his street number or his
telephone?” chuckled Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be ridiculous!” exclaimed Agnes, quite
in earnest. “What do you suppose it means,
Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“It seems awfully funny,” observed the oldest
Kenway girl. “‘Christopher Columbus, 1492.’
It’s not possible.”
</p>
<p>
“One thing sure,” said Neale dryly: “They
spelled just as poorly in those days as they do
now.”
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be possible!” exclaimed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I remember Christopher Columbus,” said
Tess practically. “We learned about him at
school.”
</p>
<p>
“So we did!” shouted Dot, with sudden energy.
“You know—‘First in war, first in peace, and
first in the hearts of his coun-tri-men!’”
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw!” exclaimed Tess. “That was George
Washington, Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it is a most remarkable thing,” Ruth
said. “Can’t we keep him to show Mr. Howbridge
and Luke?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure will,” declared Neale. “Wait till I
drive him up above highwater mark. And into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
the shade, too; for this sun would dry him to
powder, seems to me, in an hour. I’ll turn him
over in the shade and then let’s all take a swim.
It should be safe enough in the pool where the
<em>Isobel</em> is anchored.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know how you think we girls are
going to go bathing, Neale O’Neil, when we
haven’t any bathing suits with us?” complained
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll lend you mine,” grinned her boy friend.
“But isn’t there anything you girls can wear?”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like a dip,” sighed Ruth. “We can let
the children go in with you boys. And then
Agnes and I will take our turn by ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“You think of so many nice things, Neale,”
said Agnes. “Why can’t you invent us some
bathing suits?”
</p>
<p>
“I might paint the lily and adorn the rose,”
grumbled Neale O’Neil. “But I am no modiste.
I—guess—not!”
</p>
<p>
However, after the heat of the day was over
they all found means of getting a cool dip. Meanwhile
they compared notes. Neale had supplied
a most excellent stew of turtle meat, for they had
plenty of seasoning, and he had likewise discovered
specimens of the plantain, the fruit of which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
added to the variety of the repast. He was
acclaimed a wonderful chef by all.
</p>
<p>
On the part of Mr. Howbridge and Luke, although
they bore upon their hands and faces plentiful
marks of toil in grease and smut, they could
not report that much progress had been made in
repairing the engine. That matter really seemed
almost hopeless.
</p>
<p>
“But there is something of even greater importance,”
Mr. Howbridge said the next morning to
Neale and Luke. “I am worried about the water
question.”
</p>
<p>
“What fell day before yesterday, I suppose,
was soon burned up,” Luke reflected.
</p>
<p>
“You said it,” agreed Neale.
</p>
<p>
So, following the usual siesta, for nobody could
work even at this time of year in the full heat of
the sun, the boys and Mr. Howbridge set off
through the brush to sound every likely spot for
water, leaving the girls at the dish-washing. They
did not have a shovel but they had a broken oar
and sticks with which to prod the ground for any
dampness that might promise a living spring.
</p>
<p>
The smaller girls were by this time anxious to
run about again. They were much interested in
“Mr. Methuselah,” as Neale had dubbed the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
turtle on which had been engraved by somebody
the name of the discoverer of America and the
correct date of that discovery.
</p>
<p>
“But it makes him awfully old,” Tess said
gravely. “How old does it make the turtle,
Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the older sister, “if we are to believe
that Christopher Columbus carved his name
and the date on that turtle when he first came to
these islands, it must have been more than four
and a quarter centuries ago.”
</p>
<p>
“O-oo!” gasped Dot. “That’s awful old, isn’t
it?”
</p>
<p>
“And the turtle must have been pretty big when
the carving was done,” laughed Ruth. “It takes
a couple of hundred years for them to gain full
size, I believe.”
</p>
<p>
“What a joke!” ejaculated Agnes. “Then
this turtle would be at least six hundred years old
right now.”
</p>
<p>
“It would seem so,” agreed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“I guess he must be,” said Tess gravely. “He
looks that old. He is the oldest looking thing I
ever saw.”
</p>
<p>
Just then Neale gave a shout, and called to
them. The four Corner House girls responded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
by hurrying to the spot where Neale had come out
of the shrubs.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s another!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“Another what?” demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But she saw what he referred to the next moment.
Neale was dancing in front of a big turtle
and poking it with his stick to keep it from descending
the beach to the sea.
</p>
<p>
“Come on!” Neale cried. “Here’s another one
with his calling card on his back.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean it!” cried Ruth. “Is he
dated, too? Is it Amerigo Vespucci?”
</p>
<p>
“Wait! This fellow will keep going. There
must have been some practical jokers in this
neighborhood. Look, Agnes! What are those
letters?”
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake!” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
But Agnes, almost choked with laughter, spelled
out the following inscription on the turtle’s shell:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;JULES&nbsp;CESAR<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;48<br />
</p>
<p>
“Four years before Cæsar died,” exclaimed
Ruth, casting back in her mind to ancient history
lessons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
“And what do you know about the ‘B. C.’?
Cæsar must have known they were going to
change the calendar,” chuckled Neale. “And the
same informality of spelling. It seems Cæsar and
Columbus must have gone to the same school.”
</p>
<p>
“And,” said Agnes, gravely, but with dancing
eyes, “if we accept the one as <em>bona fide</em>, then we
must believe this one, too. This turtle is nearly
two thousand years old.”
</p>
<p>
“O-oo!” gasped Tess.
</p>
<p>
“‘Julius Cæsar’ is the name of Bill Monnegan,
the coal man’s, horse,” declared Dot. “And that
horse never could have cut those letters into that
turtle. So I guess it is maybe a joke, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“It must be a joke,” laughed Ruth. Then,
quite seriously, she added: “But think! Maybe
this island isn’t always deserted. Perhaps other
people have been here and will come again.”
</p>
<p>
“These turtles travel many hundreds of miles,
Ruth,” Neale said quietly. “This discovery, I
guess, offers no particular hope that we shall
have visitors. But, of course, we’ll get that old
engine to working before long.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—LOOKING FOR ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>
Imagine becoming bored on a desert island in
the tropics! But that is exactly what happened
in the case of Dot Kenway. Nor was Tess in
much finer fettle on the fourth morning of their
sojourn on Palm Island.
</p>
<p>
“I wish we had Tom Jonah here. Or even
Billy Bumps,” said Tess to her smaller sister.
“There isn’t really much to play with on this
place but turtles. And they only lie on their
backs and wave their paws at you.”
</p>
<p>
“It is too bad we didn’t bring that rabbit along
that Sammy Pinkney gave us for Christmas,”
said Dot, quite as ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“That old Belgian hare!”
</p>
<p>
“We-ell, the Belgians are all right, I guess.
They live over there in Europe.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess that rabbit never came from Bel-Belgia,
or whatever that place is called,” said
Tess.
</p>
<p>
“And we don’t even know <em>his</em> name,” went on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
Dot. “We came away so soon after Christmas,
and it snowed in between, that I didn’t see that
rabbit at all. But Uncle Rufus said it had a good
appetite.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m hungry myself,” announced Tess, rather
despondently. “If I tell Ruth she’ll only give
me some funny fruit and tell me to eat it and be
thankful.”
</p>
<p>
“M-mm. I know,” rejoined Dot, appreciating
this. “But how can you be thankful for something
you don’t want? Now, if I had a piece of
bread and butter——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! And with honey on it!”
</p>
<p>
“No. Apricot jam. I like that better.”
</p>
<p>
“Of all the stingy children!” exclaimed Tess,
in a strangely quarrelsome mood for her.
“When I want honey!”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you have honey if you want to? And
me have apricot jam? It’s only in our minds,
anyway,” mourned Dot, hugging up the Alice-doll.
“Say, Tess, let’s do something.”
</p>
<p>
“What is there to do in this place?” repeated
her sister despondently.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Howbridge and Luke and Neale have
gone hunting for springs again. Ruth told them
she had just got to have fresh water. I don’t
know what for,” Dot remarked. “They have almost got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
the engine fixed. I heard Neale say so.
Let us go see it.”
</p>
<p>
This suggestion for action was better than no
action at all. Tess agreed, and, unseen by the
older girls, the two little ones made their way
down to the rocky cove where the Isobel lay. She
was not even at anchor now, for the anchor had
been raised and the motor-boat drawn very close
in to the rocks, as it was high tide. The log still
lay like a gangplank from the rock to the forward
part of the Isobel.
</p>
<p>
The boys and Mr. Howbridge had gone away
and left the motor-boat in rather a precarious
situation, but quite without realizing it. The
tide was rising and that served to lift the log and
make it rather unsafe for Tess and Dot to pass
over; and when the little girls had done so,
splash! The log fell into the water between the
boat and the shore.
</p>
<p>
“O-oo! Now see what we’ve done,” gasped
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. Neale will find another. And
we can stay here till he comes back,” Tess declared.
</p>
<p>
She did not notice, however, that the accident
had brought a sudden strain upon the single line
that bound the boat to the shore. This mooring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
was not very skillfully made, for neither Neale
nor Luke were practical sailors, and so were not
professional rope-knotters.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, with the falling of the log the
hull of the <em>Isobel</em> strained at the small hawser,
and that rope loosened, almost imperceptibly at
first, from the rock around which it had been
looped.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot did not see this. They got down
into the cockpit, and from that place they could
not see the rocks without standing up, nor could
they be seen themselves from the shore.
</p>
<p>
The motor-boat rose and fell rather pleasantly
upon the surface of the inlet. The tide had now
risen to its highest point, and as it turned and
began to recede, naturally everything afloat in
the little cove began to drift out to sea. The log
that had served as a gangplank between the <em>Isobel</em>
and the shore went first, but soon the motor-boat
likewise got into the tide and blundered out
through the mouth of the narrow estuary.
</p>
<p>
Strange as it may seem, the two smallest Corner
House girls did not discover what had happened
until the bobbing motor-boat was quite a
long way from the island. It was then the freshening
wind, that made the boat “joggle,” which
first annoyed Dot Kenway.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish this boat would stay still, Tess,” she
complained. “Let’s go back to the land. I feel
all joggled up inside me.”
</p>
<p>
Tess jumped up. “Why-ee!” she gasped.
“Where—where is Palm Island?”
</p>
<p>
“Where is what?” her sister demanded, likewise
scrambling to her feet.
</p>
<p>
They were both facing seaward. There were
islands in that direction, but smaller ones, and,
it seemed to Tess and Dot, a vast distance away!
Tess whirled around. Palm Island was behind
them. The motor-boat was blundering away
from their refuge and their sisters and their
friends!
</p>
<p>
If Dot and Tess had been looking for adventure,
they certainly had found it this time.
</p>
<p>
“Is that Plam Island?” Dot demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it is.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but what’s it doing ‘way over there?”
quavered Dot. “I thought we were tied to it.”
</p>
<p>
“We came untied I guess,” said Tess, despondently,
seeing the rope dragging over the
boat’s rail. “Oh, dear me!”
</p>
<p>
“I told you I didn’t like this place, Tess Kenway!”
stormed Dot. “And now see what’s happened
to us. Ruthie will be awful mad.”
</p>
<p>
But Tess knew that Ruth would experience a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
different emotion from anger. As long as the
boat remained on even keel Tess did not see how
much harm could come to them. But suppose
they bumped into something?
</p>
<p>
“Let’s shout!” she urged, climbing upon one
of the seats. “Maybe they will hear us.”
</p>
<p>
But the wind was blowing from the direction
of Palm Island, and that and the tide carried the
<em>Isobel</em> away from their friends, and carried the
sound of their shrill voices away, too.
</p>
<p>
It was an hour later before anybody on Palm
Island imagined that anything out of the way had
befallen Tess and Dot Kenway.
</p>
<p>
There was good reason for the fact that Tess
and Dot were not soon missed. The older sisters
had left the little ones playing near the tent
when they strolled away themselves to see if any
success was attending the efforts of the boys and
Mr. Howbridge in their search for water.
</p>
<p>
The heat of the day was over. The breeze had
sprung up and laved their faces delightfully as
the girls strolled toward the hill on which the big
palm tree grew.
</p>
<p>
The two older sisters found that the boys and
their guardian had gone around the foot of the
hill which occupied the middle of Palm Island,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
but they started to mount the slope of the smooth
eminence.
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could see some boat and attract its
attention,” sighed Ruth, as they went on. “Then
it wouldn’t matter about the water supply or
about repairing the engine of the Isobel.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess we have been castaways long enough,”
agreed Agnes. “It would be awful if we had
to stay here much longer. Think of our nice
dresses there at the hotel all going to waste.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth smiled indulgently. “We can wear them
when we go back North.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they’ll be almost old by that time,” declared
the younger girl sadly. “And I did so
want to wear ’em where Nalbro Hastings and
those other girls could see that we weren’t
frumps, even if we did come from Milton.”
</p>
<p>
“I never!” exclaimed Ruth, laughing. “You
are the strangest girl, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“Ought not to be strange to you, Ruthie.
You’ve known me all my life,” remarked the flyaway
sister, smiling. “And I did want to sport
my new frocks!”
</p>
<p>
“So you shall,” said Ruth, comfortingly. “I
don’t think we shall have to remain on Palm
Island much longer. Luke tells me he is sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
that the engine will be all right soon. He knows
a good deal about such things.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth!” exclaimed Agnes suddenly,
“there’s a boat coming to rescue us now!”
</p>
<p>
They were about half way up the slope of the
hill. Agnes had turned to look back, and right
over the lower trees and the rocky end of the
island a craft of some kind was visible. Ruth,
quite as excited as her sister, turned sharply to
look in the direction Agnes pointed.
</p>
<p>
“From that way?” she murmured. “St. Sergius
isn’t over there, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care. You can see the boat, can’t
you?” cried Agnes eagerly. “Hurrah! I want
to tell Neale. I saw the boat first.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait!” commanded Ruth, seizing the excited
girl’s arm. “That boat is not coming this way,
I am afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s never got past the island without our
seeing it!” wailed Agnes. “Never!”
</p>
<p>
“I—don’t—know——”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we had put up a flag—a signal of some
kind,” Agnes continued to complain. “Oh,
Ruthie! If they have gone right by without seeing
us! I would have sacrificed my sports skirt for
a flag and worn—worn a gunny sack, if necessary!
This is too mean.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait, Aggie!” exclaimed Ruth, still staring
at the boat Agnes had first spied. “There—there
is something the matter with that boat.
What propels it?”
</p>
<p>
“It is a motor-boat like ours, of course,” rejoined
Agnes quickly.
</p>
<p>
“It is not moving fast enough for that. And
there is no sail. And I cannot see anything moving
on that boat.”
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake, Ruthie! Is it a boat sailing
all by itself?” Agnes demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. That is what it is. The boat has
broken away——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, now!” gasped Agnes. “Isn’t that
strange? And it’s a motor-boat like the
<em>Isobel</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aggie!” cried Ruth, turning to her with
a frightened face now. “Aggie! It is our boat!
It’s broken away, somehow. We are now really
cast away on this island. What will become of
us?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes Kenway felt immense dismay at the possibility
of the truth of her sister’s statement.
But Ruth was so utterly despairing that the
younger girl felt she must comfort her.
</p>
<p>
“If it’s the <em>Isobel</em>, we’re lucky not to be in
her,” she said. “I guess we would have to wait
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
for some other boat to come after us, anyway; so
we are no worse off than we were before.”
</p>
<p>
“How can you say that?” Ruth demanded.
“Luke was sure he had almost got at the cause
of the trouble with the mechanism.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s not cry about it,” begged Agnes.
“Oh, don’t, Ruth! If Tess and Dot see you in
tears——”
</p>
<p>
Ruth dried her eyes suddenly. “I wonder
where the children are?” she murmured. “I
wonder if they have seen the boat drifting
away?”
</p>
<p>
“And I don’t believe Neale O’Neil knows about
it. I am going to run and tell him,” said Agnes,
who always made Neale a partner in everything
that happened to her.
</p>
<p>
She darted off excitedly. Ruth started back
toward their camp. As she pushed through the
shrubs, hastening her steps, she wondered where
Tess and Dot were. By and by she began to call
them by name; but she received no reply save
the raucous cries of the water-fowl and the chattering
of parakeets.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Kenway began to be alarmed in earnest.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—A NIGHT OF DESPAIR</h2>
<p>
Agnes Kenway was as light-footed as a deer.
She ran as hard as she could around the slope of
the hill on which the big palm grew, and thence
down into the green wood. She shouted as she
ran and soon heard Neale O’Neil reply.
</p>
<p>
“What’s broken loose, Aggie?” demanded the
boy, as soon as she came into view of the waterhunting
party.
</p>
<p>
“That’s exactly what has happened, Neale,”
she returned, in accents which assured both
Neale and the others that she was quite in earnest.
“Something has broken away! The Isobel!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge came running with Luke. The
lawyer’s face was white, for he had heard the
girl’s statement.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean that the boat is gone?” he
cried.
</p>
<p>
“So Ruthie says. She is sure,” choked Agnes.
“We saw it from up there on the hill.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
Luke and Neale at once dashed away, climbing
the hillside with great leaps. But Agnes remained
with her guardian.
</p>
<p>
“We had just found a spring. A good one,
too,” murmured the troubled gentleman. “Well,
perhaps that is a good thing. If the boat has
really drifted away.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! It has! It has!” cried the girl.
“Everything bad is happening to us. I wish we
were at home at the Corner House again.”
</p>
<p>
“Tut, tut! That is no way to talk,” said Mr.
Howbridge, and took her arm as they started in
an easterly direction again.
</p>
<p>
They had not gone far when the two young
fellows returned. Both of them looked grave,
and Luke said quickly:
</p>
<p>
“You can’t fool Ruthie. She is always right.
That is the <em>Isobel</em> out there and she’s all of two
miles away already.”
</p>
<p>
“She’ll run right into one of those small islands
and be wrecked,” said Neale. “Say, Mr. Howbridge!
isn’t this a pretty pickle?”
</p>
<p>
The party hurried on toward their camp, but
they could not overtake Ruth. It was not until
they passed the tent that Neale said:
</p>
<p>
“Wonder where Tess and Dot are? Seen ’em
lately, Aggie?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, they must be with Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“But there is Ruth now,” cried Luke, increasing
his stride. “I don’t see the children with
her.”
</p>
<p>
“Truly, the <em>Isobel</em> has drifted away,” muttered
Mr. Howbridge, as they now came in sight
of the inlet and the place where the crippled
motor-boat had been moored.
</p>
<p>
The younger people, however, made him no
reply. They had suddenly lost interest in the
matter of the boat. They were all gazing at
Ruth Kenway. Her attitude, as she stood on a
high bowlder at the edge of the water, looking
off upon the sea, was almost tragic.
</p>
<p>
Luke bounded ahead at last, reaching the girl
much in advance of the others.
</p>
<p>
“Ruth! Ruth!” he exclaimed. “What is it?
Tess—Dot——”
</p>
<p>
Her hands were clasped tightly against her
breast. She did not turn or even look down at
him. But her lips moved stiffly and he heard
what she said:
</p>
<p>
“Luke! They are out there! My darling
children—my little sisters that I promised
mother when she died I would always take care
of! Oh, Luke! They are gone—gone!”
</p>
<p>
He sprang up then beside the girl. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
well he did so, for she wavered and would have
fallen had his arm not been around her.
</p>
<p>
“Ruth! Ruth!” shrieked Agnes, now flying
over the sands to the rocky shore. “They are
not on the boat? Oh, they <em>can’t</em> be!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge was aroused to the seriousness
of the happening. The disappearance of Tess
and Dot was a tragedy that dwarfed altogether
the loss of the motor-boat.
</p>
<p>
“I saw them! I saw them!” panted Ruth,
lying in Luke’s arms for the moment. “They
waved something on a stick. I think it was Tess’
skirt. But the boat is too far away now for you
to see it.”
</p>
<p>
“And not a thing to follow them in,” muttered
Neale.
</p>
<p>
Agnes put a quick palm over his mouth.
Thoughtless as the flyaway sister usually was,
she realized at this moment the feelings that
racked her sister. For Ruth had been responsible
for the safety of the little ones, and Agnes
knew that nothing could be said to make the older
girl forget that fact.
</p>
<p>
The sun was fast declining. They all knew
that the twilight would be short. Indeed, nightfall
in the tropics is almost sudden enough to
scare one. The last ray of the sun disappears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
and in an instant it would seem it is velvety dark
and the stars pop out!
</p>
<p>
It did not seem possible that they could do anything
to help or to follow Tess and Dot; in any
case, not at night. The boat was so far away
that they could merely distinguish it as a black-red
blotch upon the ocean, where the departing
rays of the sun touched the moving object.
</p>
<p>
The children were too small to be seen, even
had they stood upon the decked-over forward
part of the <em>Isobel</em>. They were, of course, in the
cockpit or in the cabin. All alone upon the
ocean! The thought smote the others as well as
Ruth Kenway with horror and alarm.
</p>
<p>
They stood there on the rocks, staring seaward.
Not a craft was in sight save the drifting
<em>Isobel</em>. It was a lonely stretch of water, with
perhaps half a dozen small islands in sight. The
lost craft might be drifting toward another
strand, or it might pass right out between the
islands and go to sea. For Neale’s chart portrayed
the fact that beyond this group of the Tortugas,
the islands where the pirates used to careen
their schooners and scrape their hulls of
barnacles, was the tropical Atlantic Ocean.
</p>
<p>
It was a hopeless group indeed on Palm Island.
Perhaps more hopeless and unhappy than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
the two little girls themselves who were the object
of so much solicitude. It was true that Dot
had cried a little, but she had the Alice-doll with
her, and was soon comforted. Tess, from her
very nature, was likely to consider the situation
more interesting than threatening.
</p>
<p>
Here was a chance for Tess to take the lead;
and she certainly loved to “boss.” Dot was
quite ready to sit down and allow her older sister
to arrange matters. That was by far the
easier way. Then, if things went wrong, there
was always Tess to be blamed.
</p>
<p>
The older sister assumed responsibility with
the joy of an oyster imbibing sea-water. She immediately
became possessed of the idea that she
really might do something to aid in their difficulty.
They were afloat on rather a big ocean,
as far as she could see, and without means of
propelling the <em>Isobel</em> in any way the current did
not go; nevertheless, Tess took the wheel, as she
had seen Mr. Howbridge and the boys do, and
proceeded to “steer” the motor-boat on her
course.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you turn it around and make it run
back to Plam Island again?” Dot wanted to know
with what might have been considered sarcasm
from an older person.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now, you know very well that the engine isn’t
running,” said Tess, “And so the propellers
aren’t making any splatter in the water. So we
could not make her go back to the island. The
tide will carry us—carry us——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, where’s it going to carry us?” Dot demanded,
a good deal more efficient as a question-asker
than a question-answerer.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Dorothy Kenway!” exclaimed Tess,
very self-important, “I wish you would not sit
there and ask such things. I am no better acquainted
around here than you are.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s an island,” said Dot, standing up to
look ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I see there is. Perhaps this boat wants
to go there. I am sure I would just as lief be on
land as out here in this boat.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose—suppose there is somebody on that
island?” quavered Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t be any harm in that.”
</p>
<p>
“Or something to hurt us? A big, big——”
</p>
<p>
“Turtle,” finished Tess practically. “That
Mr. Methuselah didn’t really hurt you, Dot, if he
did start to run off with you. You can look
where you are sitting, next time, can’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I hope Neale O’Neil or somebody will
come after us,” sighed Dot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Tess became very thoughtful. She
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Why, they won’t know we are in this boat at
all! They can’t see us over the sides. Here,
Dot! You take this steer-a-ma-jig.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe, Tess Kenway, that does any
good,” said Dot. “The boat goes just where it
wants to, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
This very sensible statement rather annoyed
Tess. But she was in earnest. She found a
boathook and hurried to remove her skirt, which
was plaid with much red in it. This she fastened
to the rusty hook and set it up in the stern of the
<em>Isobel</em>. As a flag of distress it was a good deal
better than nothing.
</p>
<p>
Then Tess went back to the steering wheel.
She did not, herself, see that what she did to it
made any difference; but one must do something.
She looked ahead at the island which the bow
of the motor-boat was aimed for. The current
that had seized the drifting boat undoubtedly
laved the shore of this island, which was not, as
Tess could see, half the size of Palm Island.
There was a goodly group of palm trees on it,
but the white beach, as far as the little girls could
see it, was very narrow.
</p>
<p>
In fact, it was a true coral island, built entirely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
by the coral insects. Sand had been washed
upon the coral reefs by the sea until the soil was
raised slightly above the surface of the water.
Birds had brought and dropped seeds of tropical
plants here. The waves had washed ashore
logs and other refuse to decay and aid in forming
a crust of friable soil.
</p>
<p>
Thus, in thousands and thousands of years, had
grown up the island. Ruth had told Tess and
Dot all about the formation of such bits of land,
and the little girls had been much interested in
the story. Now, in the fast-dimming evening
light, they watched the green and white edge of
the little island the boat was approaching with
some uncertainty in the mind of Tess as well as
of Dot.
</p>
<p>
If they did bump into that island what was in
store for them?
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess,” said Tess, finally, “we’d better
go downstairs into the cabin and go to bed; and—and—let
her bump.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE RAFT</h2>
<p>
With the night shut down upon Palm Island
and the sea there was absolutely no use in the
anxious party standing longer at the inlet, out
of which the <em>Isobel</em> had drifted, carrying the two
little girls. Even Ruth recognized the futility of
remaining longer on the shore.
</p>
<p>
Neale hurried ahead to the camp and started
a fire. They had plenty of thoroughly seasoned
driftwood, and when the flames began licking
about the broken chunks their hues of green,
amber, and pink were very pretty. To-night,
however, even Agnes did not exclaim over the
delicate beauty of the flames.
</p>
<p>
The party ate what Neale and the girls prepared,
and there was very little said among the
quintette. Agnes frequently went to Ruth and
put her arms about her. The younger sister felt
so sorry for the older that she almost forgot her
own anxiety for the safety of the little girls.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Howbridge could say nothing to aid Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
or the others or to make them feel more cheerful.
The absence of Tess and Dot was a thing
that could not be lessened by any further talk.
Even now, in the pitch darkness of the tropical
night, the <em>Isobel</em> might have come to grief and
the children be cast into the sea.
</p>
<p>
These thoughts were so bitter that occasionally
the lawyer groaned aloud. Luke, clinging
to one of Ruth’s hands, felt the girl tremble every
time her guardian gave voice to his bitter feelings.
Agnes sobbed now and then convulsively.
And for once Neale could find no silver lining
to this cloud of trouble.
</p>
<p>
The little girls had often caused the older ones
anxiety; they had been lost; they had got into
mischief that might have proved dangerous; but
this situation seemed far and away more terrible
than anything that had previously happened to
the Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot had drifted away once in a boat
at Pleasant Cove, but Tom Jonah, the faithful,
had then been in their company. Now they were
adrift on an unknown sea, in the dark, and with
a hundred perils threatening them. Ruth felt
that never before had her little sisters been in
such danger while she was unable to lift a finger
to help them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
She scarcely touched the food placed before
her. Even Luke could not comfort Ruth Kenway
now. In her mind continually danced possibilities
of disaster for the two children who,
since their mother’s death, she had attended so
closely.
</p>
<p>
Her early duties as “little mother” had made
Ruth seem really older than her years. Her
thoughtfulness for her three sisters had made her
different from other girls. Agnes often declared
that Ruth “couldn’t have any fun” because
of the duties that took first place in her
mind and in her life.
</p>
<p>
The release from care that had been joined
with the coming of the four Kenways and their
Aunt Sarah Maltby to the Corner House in Milton
had not entirely erased from Ruth’s mind
certain remembrances connected with their previous
poverty in Bloomsburg. This fact, perhaps,
made her all the more charitable and
thoughtful for other people’s troubles.
</p>
<p>
And now the occasion called up in the older
girl’s mind the most doleful thoughts and surmises.
What might not happen to Tess and Dot
out on the sea in that unmanageable boat?
</p>
<p>
Ruth Kenway retired to the tent and nobody
but Agnes followed to comfort her. And Agnes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
was not much of a comforter. She gave way
too easily to her own despair to be of help to her
sister.
</p>
<p>
The latter heard Mr. Howbridge and the boys
talking together over the embers of the fire long
after Agnes had fallen into a restless sleep. For
her own part, Ruth could not sleep. She could
not even close her eyes.
</p>
<p>
The question which she knew was discussed by
her three companions outside her tent before they
rolled up in their blankets was the question that
fretted persistently the girl’s mind: How to reach
Tess and Dot on the drifting boat?
</p>
<p>
If it was still adrift! Suppose it had crashed
upon some rock—some island shore? Suppose
the <em>Isobel</em> had really been wrecked at last? A hole
stove in her hull, perhaps, and the craft even
now sinking with the helpless children upon it?
</p>
<p>
Then Ruth heard the gentle soughing of the
waves on the strand below the camp, and she took
heart again. The sea was so quiet, the wind was
so gentle, it scarcely seemed possible that the
<em>Isobel</em> could be wrecked. But the wind and the
current were both driving the motor-boat away
from Palm Island if, by chance, she was not cast
away.
</p>
<p>
The fact of disaster Ruth tried to deny. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
sea was so gentle even the lightest bark must
be safe upon it. There was practically no surf.
The waves merely lapped against the strand with
a very soothing and reassuring noise.
</p>
<p>
“Why, a mere raft would not be in danger!”
the girl thought.
</p>
<p>
And with this conclusion there suddenly
stabbed her mind the thought that the means of
following and rescuing Tess and Dot might lie
in the very thing she pictured. <em>A raft.</em>
</p>
<p>
There were plenty of trees upon Palm Island,
as well as much flotsam timber on the shores of
it. There was a heavy boat ax and a few other
tools that had been removed, fortunately enough,
from the <em>Isobel</em>. In the jungle were green vines
and lianas as tough in fiber as commercial rope.
She knew just how the raft could be built and
where. They could strike the tent and make a
big sail of it. If the trade wind continued to
blow, and she was sure it would do so, for its
direction had been the same since they had left
St. Sergius, the raft would be propelled in the
same general direction as the <em>Isobel</em>.
</p>
<p>
She sat up and threw off her coverings. She
could not wait until morning to discuss this thing
with Luke. When she peered out through the
tent opening only the blinking embers of the fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
gave any light in the wood at all. But she heard
her friends breathing near her.
</p>
<p>
Luke was nearest. She crept over to him and
shook the young fellow by the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“All right!” muttered the collegian. “What’s
up?”
</p>
<p>
“I am,” said Ruth, in a shaky whisper.
</p>
<p>
“Is anything the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course there is,” cried the girl, but under
her breath. “Aren’t those blessed children in
danger?”
</p>
<p>
“But, Ruth! We can’t help that just now. Not
while it’s dark.”
</p>
<p>
“And what are you going to do when light
comes?” demanded Ruth, with some exasperation.
</p>
<p>
Luke Shepard groaned. What could he say to
soothe the girl of whom he was so very fond?
</p>
<p>
“Hadn’t you better try to get some sleep,
Ruth?” he finally said.
</p>
<p>
But he did not wholly know Ruth Kenway,
much as he admired her. He had not known her
in the days when she had borne the entire burden
of the Kenways’ domestic troubles. He had no
idea that her very active mind was bound to exert
itself until some reasonable method of helping
Tess and Dot was evolved.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” she commanded, sternly. “Listen,
Luke. The children must be brought back.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie!”
</p>
<p>
“It may sound impossible to you, but it isn’t
impossible. It means hard work, and you boys
and Mr. Howbridge must practically do it all.
But I have thought of a way.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” gasped Luke, sitting up
quickly. “Come away from here. Don’t wake
Mr. Howbridge. You can tell me first, can’t
you?”
</p>
<p>
“I mean to tell you first,” declared Ruth, quite
undisturbed by his expressed doubt.
</p>
<p>
Luke hurried her away from the camp. They
reached the open beach where the starlight gave
to the scene a bland radiance. At another time
both the young people would have considered it
a lovely view and would have spoken of it. But
now——
</p>
<p>
“What is it you have thought of, Ruth?” demanded
the youth, holding her hand and looking
closely at her.
</p>
<p>
“I know how we can—how we must—go after
Tess and Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth!”
</p>
<p>
She explained. The idea of a good-sized raft,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
with sail and two oars (these had belonged to the
<em>Isobel</em>), was rapidly sketched by the girl in no
faltering accents. Luke soon began to take fire
at her plan. His eyes sparkled and he could
scarcely wait for her to complete her details.
</p>
<p>
“Ruth! It’s a wonder of an idea! Of course
we can!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she said with a sudden sob, “if it were
only daylight. All the time the dear little things
are floating farther and farther away.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say another word!” exclaimed Luke,
eagerly. “I don’t care if it is dark! Wait!
What time is it?” He struck a match and looked
at his wrist watch. “Twelve-twenty-five. The
darkest time of all the night, but you can see
pretty well out here on the shore. There are
plenty of fallen logs at the edge of the grove, over
toward the inlet where the <em>Isobel</em> lay.”
</p>
<p>
“So there are, Luke.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll want to build the raft there. Then we
can push her out right into the wake of the motorboat.
I’ll wake Neale. Don’t disturb your
guardian yet. Neale and I can do a lot before
morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Luke,” she sighed, “you are such a comfort.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
Luke sped back to the camp and shook Neale
awake in a jiffy, and without hearing the anxious
girl’s approbation.
</p>
<p>
“Wha-what’s the matter?” asked the younger
youth, sitting up and rubbing his eyes vigorously.
“Nobody’s come to rescue us, has there,
Luke?”
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” commanded the collegian. “No.
But we’ve found a way to go after Tess and
Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“Crackey!” gasped Neale, struggling out from
under the blanket. “It will be a long, hard swim,
Luke. I had thought of that.”
</p>
<p>
“Ruth has got an idea—and a good one,” declared
Luke.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that puts another face upon the matter,
as the fellow said when he put on his masque at
the costume ball. Ruth is a regular ‘go-getter’
when it comes to ideas. What is it?”
</p>
<p>
He hurried after Luke through the grove and
they came out upon the easterly point of Palm
Island, where the rocky reefs guarded the inlet
whence the motor-boat had floated away.
</p>
<p>
Luke had already begun in a low voice to explain
to Neale the details of Ruth’s idea. The
younger fellow was immediately excited. The
idea of making a raft that would bear them all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
up and float them over the quiet sea in pursuit
of the motor-boat seemed the most feasible thing
in the world.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, if Mr. Howbridge had been awakened
at this time, his riper judgment might have
pointed out facts that would have seemed to show
flaws in Ruth’s idea. But Luke and Neale accepted
the plan at its face value and went to work
immediately. As well as they could in the starlight
they began to drag certain fallen tree trunks
together on the shore by the deep inlet, ready for
the real task of building the raft. They had a
rope and with its aid dragged the logs through
the sands.
</p>
<p>
Agnes awoke and came out and insisted upon
helping the young fellows. Ruth, too, was too
restless and excited to remain idle. Before dawn—oh,
long before!—all four of them had aching
shoulders and backs and blistered palms. But
they worked on without complaint, believing that
they were at last doing something practical
toward the recovery of the lost children.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—THE FLAG ON THE TREE-TOP</h2>
<p>
“But it is practical, Guardy!” cried Agnes, at
breakfast. “You know our Ruth is always practical.”
</p>
<p>
“Far be it from me to say that it is not practical—theoretically,”
rejoined Mr. Howbridge,
referring, as Agnes did, to the idea of building
a raft.
</p>
<p>
“I guess whatever will float us off this island
after the <em>Isobel</em> is good enough to try,” said
Neale O’Neil, just a little sullenly.
</p>
<p>
“We will do all that can be done with the idea,
of course,” agreed Mr. Howbridge.
</p>
<p>
“But,” ventured Ruth slowly, herself a little
timid now, “you see something dangerous about
it?”
</p>
<p>
“I hope not, my dear girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we build a raft big enough to carry us
all?” demanded Luke.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose even that might be done,” admitted
Mr. Howbridge. “But, you know, there are five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
of us, and we are of some weight. The raft must
cover sufficient area to bear us up, and the children
as well when we get them, if, perchance, the
motor-boat should be unusable.”
</p>
<p>
“Those logs do float pretty deep in the water,”
observed Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Green logs,” said Luke, joining in. “They
are almost awash.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we use the seasoned timber along
shore?” asked Ruth, faintly.
</p>
<p>
“Not so well,” Luke said thoughtfully. “You
see, that is of all sizes and shapes. The easiest
way to build the raft is with these trimmed
logs. But most of the trees were felled during
that small hurricane which brought us to the
island.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” wailed Agnes, “don’t say that it can’t
be done.”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all,” said Mr. Howbridge, briskly.
“We are going to bind those timbers together
right after we have eaten, step a mast, bend a
sail, and set sail. But we must not make the raft
too cumbersome; therefore we cannot all embark
in this venture.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>
But Agnes shouted: “I’m going! I don’t care,
Guardy Howbridge! If Neale goes, I’m going.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
“Agnes!” murmured Ruth, putting a restraining
hand upon her sister’s arm.
</p>
<p>
“You’re going, I suppose, Agnes, even if you
have to walk?” chuckled Mr. Howbridge, for he
knew the obstreperous Agnes pretty well by this
time.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you do, child,” said the lawyer more earnestly.
“You care very much about getting Tess
and Dot back safely. We may have much difficulty
in managing the raft. Especially on our
return. The boat may be broken, or perhaps we
cannot finish repairing the mechanism when we
overtake it.
</p>
<p>
“We must build a raft of limited capacity. It
must hold the boys and me, and the children, of
course. But the added weight of you and Ruth
might sink it so deeply that it could not be managed.
You girls will remain here——”
</p>
<p>
“Alone?” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“No. Together,” put in Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Guardy!” exclaimed Ruth, “will that be
necessary? Are you sure?”
</p>
<p>
“It is a physical impossibility for us to make
these green logs float higher than they do,” said
Mr. Howbridge dryly. “Some tropical timber is
corky and very light. Not these palm logs. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
build the raft of drift timber is, as you can see
yourself, my dear, impossible. We must use
what we have to hand, and use it at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! Oh, yes!” murmured Ruth. “There
must be no more delay.”
</p>
<p>
“It will take our best efforts to manage the
raft. If the wind holds fair that canvas will
make a splendid sail; but it will have to be tended
all the time or half of the wind will be spilled, as
the sailors say. Two of us at the sail and one at
the steering oar. You two girls will have to remain
behind.”
</p>
<p>
“It is not so much the staying here,” said Ruth
shakenly. “But I wanted to find the children
myself and make sure they are all right.”
</p>
<p>
“You will have to trust that to us,” said Mr.
Howbridge. “I do not believe for a moment that
anything will happen to you girls here on Palm
Island.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am not afraid,” Ruth rejoined faintly.
</p>
<p>
“I think the camp should be moved over to the
spring. There is a sheltered place in the side of
the hill within ten yards of the spring—almost
a cave. As we must take your tent——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t bother about us!” cried Ruth. “Hurry
and finish your raft.”
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Howbridge and the two young fellows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
were determined to leave Ruth and Agnes in as
comfortable a situation as possible. In the first
place, although no one dwelt on the thought, nobody
could tell how long they would be gone from
Palm Island.
</p>
<p>
It was all very well to consider that there was
a fair wind blowing away from the island, one
that would presumably drive the raft on the
course followed by the drifting motor-boat. But
how would they ever be able to beat up against
this same wind on their return?
</p>
<p>
Even Neale and Agnes kept still about this.
“Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”
Once they find the two little girls and the motor-boat,
and everything else must come right. That was
the way the young people looked at it, anyway.
</p>
<p>
The repairs upon the engine of the <em>Isobel</em> had
been all but complete. If the boat had not been
wrecked upon one of the small islands, the trio
hoped to finish the repairs easily and bring the
craft back to Palm Island in triumph.
</p>
<p>
Now the party made haste to transfer all their
belongings from the point where the old camp
had been established to that spot west of the hill,
at the spring. The spring was a fair-flowing
stream that bubbled out from under a rock and
had worn a course for itself in the sands to high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
water mark. When the party had first walked
around the island they had overlooked this tiny
rivulet, as the tide had been coming in and the
brackish water had flowed up the course of it.
</p>
<p>
Agnes climbed the hill to the very foot of the
huge palm, carrying an old pair of binoculars
with her. She came down with flying hair and
excited eyes.
</p>
<p>
“There is something flapping in the top of a
palm tree on that first island! I can see it as
plain as plain!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“What is it—an old carrion crow?” demanded
Neale.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mean that it is alive,” returned
Agnes. “It is a flag or something!”
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose it is something the children
have put up to attract our attention?” cried
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“If it is in the top of a tree, how did they get
it up there?” questioned Luke.
</p>
<p>
“We-ell. They put up something in the boat;
Tess’s skirt, I think,” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
They could not stop to investigate Agnes Kenway’s
discovery at this time. But when they
went back to the inlet where the raft lay, Mr.
Howbridge climbed upon a rock with the glasses
and examined the fluttering thing which Agnes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
had marked in the tree-top on the first island of
the chain to the east.
</p>
<p>
There was no other sign of life or occupancy;
but certain it was that some sort of pennant fluttered
in the breeze. Tess and Dot could not, of
course, have climbed so high to fasten a signal of
distress, even had they thought of doing such a
thing; but this mysterious pennant seemed a
promise that the island was occupied.
</p>
<p>
If the little voyagers had come in the drifting
motor-boat to this island and been stranded, they
might have found somebody already there—somebody
who would take care of them.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s mind was a little relieved by this
thought. Perhaps Tess and Dot were not entirely
alone. The thought of their having remained
alone over night on the sea or on the
lonely strand had made the older sister acutely
miserable.
</p>
<p>
She and Agnes saw the two boys and Mr. Howbridge
set sail upon the rude raft with less anxiety
than they would have felt had they realized
how treacherous both the sea and the weather
was in this locality. They had forgotten, in this
new trouble, the savageness and abruptness of
the storm that had cast them all upon Palm
Island.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
The raft blundered out of the inlet, the boys
guiding it with the oars. But the great, square
sail was already bent upon the mast and one
yard. As Mr. Howbridge had said, as soon as
they were really adrift Luke and Neale had to
“tend sheet.” They had to keep the canvas
trimmed all the time to hold the wind.
</p>
<p>
The raft began to move at a pace that momentarily
increased. A little ruffle of white water
showed before the blunt nose of the heavy craft.
The girls, standing with clasped hands on the
rocky shore, watched the ponderously moving
raft with great anxiety.
</p>
<p>
Now and then one of the boys turned to wave a
confident hand to Ruth and Agnes. But both
Luke and Neale, as well as Mr. Howbridge, felt
more worriment for the safety of Ruth and Agnes
than they cared to have the girls imagine.
</p>
<p>
They had been several days on Palm Island
and had seen no vessel in the offing but their own
and had marked no trace on the island of any
former occupant. It might seem that there was
really nothing on or about Palm Island to bring
to it any person, either kindly or evilly disposed.
</p>
<p>
There was one thing, however, that Neale
O’Neil had pointed out to Mr. Howbridge. They
had considered the possibility in secret of certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
fellows of the baser sort coming to the place, but
nothing of this had been said before the girls.
If they had not thought of that themselves, it was
not desirable to bring it to their attention and
burden them with one more anxiety.
</p>
<p>
The three masculine members of the party of
castaways had absolutely to go in search of Tess
and Dot. The raft could not be made big enough
to transport in safety Ruth and Agnes too.
Would the raft return? This was a desperate
situation.
</p>
<p>
The girls watched the raft move heavily away
in the white glare of the sun, now almost overhead.
The blot of shadow cast by the huge sail
was very narrow. The glare of the view at last
so blinded them that Ruth and Agnes retired to
the covert of the cocoanut grove.
</p>
<p>
From this vantage point they could see the raft
as it rose and fell upon the long, sweeping surges.
Slowly, but steadily, it moved away from Palm
Island toward that islet on which the flag had appeared
and upon which Ruth hoped the children
had taken refuge.
</p>
<p>
After the raft was so far away that the boys
and girls could not shout back and forth to each
other, it seemed that it moved very slowly indeed.
Yet as the hours wore on the distance between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
the shore of Palm Island and the raft could be
plainly marked.
</p>
<p>
The figures of the trio upon the raft were
dwarfed at last to the size of manikins. The sail
looked like a palm-leaf fan. The raft itself, rising
and falling on the surge, became very small,
and to the girls’ anxious eyes it seemed nearer
to that distant island than to this one on which
they were marooned.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” said Ruth at last, sadly. “Let us go
over to the spring and get some supper and go
to bed. Watching them any longer will do no
good. We cannot help. We can only trust that
God will be good to us all. We’ll hope for the
best.”
</p>
<p>
Even the usually voluble Agnes could say nothing
cheerful in reply, and the two girls moved
away from the point of their vigil.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—A NIGHT ALARM</h2>
<p>
It was a very lonely evening for Ruth and
Agnes Kenway. The boys had made the new camp
near the spring as snug as possible. An outthrust
rock partially sheltered them, and they had
the smaller piece of sail-cloth to help keep them
dry when they lay down. They had a good fire
too.
</p>
<p>
But the wailing of the seabirds and the lap, lap,
lapping of the little waves along the strand
sounded very mournful in their ears. This tropic
world was very empty and lonely!
</p>
<p>
Their minds not only reverted constantly to the
question of the whereabouts of Tess and Dot, but the
question of the safety of their boy friends and
their guardian was now added to that first anxiety.
Ruth and Agnes did not consider that they
were in any immediate personal danger. The
thought that they might be left indefinitely on this
lonely island they resolutely kept out of the forefront
of their minds. But wreck and disaster
might have overtaken both the other parties.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
Agnes had climbed the hill just before the night
fell and tried to spy the raft again. But she could
not distinguish it. In fact, that nearest island on
which they had seen the flag flying was almost
blotted out.
</p>
<p>
“We cannot see anything until morning,” Ruth
told her. “I believe Mr. Howbridge and the boys
got to the island. If the children are there, then
it is all right.”
</p>
<p>
“All right?” repeated Agnes, with a sniff.
“How can you say that? Nothing will be all
right again, I guess, until we get back to the Corner
House. I wish we had never come South.”
</p>
<p>
“We could not foresee all this trouble,” rejoined
her sister soothingly. “We must not give
up hope, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!”
</p>
<p>
“If I only knew that Tess and Dot were safe
I would feel better. Lots of people have worse
troubles than this. Think of what the poor Pendletons
are going through, for instance.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, at least,” declared Agnes, “the Pendletons
have a roof over their heads.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye-es,” agreed Ruth thoughtfully. “And
they are all together.”
</p>
<p>
“They have somebody to help them too,” Agnes
went on more energetically. “I am sure Guardy’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
clerk will dig up some evidence to clear Mr. Pendleton.
It only takes time. But we haven’t a
soul to help us, Ruthie.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what the folks at St. Sergius think
about our absence,” murmured the older girl.
“Guardy’s friend, Señor Benno, ought to suspect
that we are in some difficulty.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish he’d send a boat for us—right now!”
cried Agnes. “Then we could go after the boys
and the raft.”
</p>
<p>
“And find Tess and Dot,” added Ruth. “This
is a dreadful thing, Agnes!”
</p>
<p>
“Who would have thought they’d do such a
thing?” was Agnes’ vigorous speech. “I’m always
expecting them to get into mischief when
Sammy Pinkney is along. But one would think
that with him thousands of miles away, Tess and
Dot could be trusted for half an hour alone.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t blame them,” sighed Ruth. “Of
course they had no intention of sailing away with
the motor-boat. It was an accident.”
</p>
<p>
“And we can’t do a thing to help,” said her
sister gloomily, and cuddled down in her blanket.
</p>
<p>
Worried as she really was, Agnes was not long
awake. Ruth tossed and turned and, as on the
night before, could not compose herself to sleep.
Each faint sound from the sea aroused her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
sharply. Were their friends coming back? Had
they found the motor-boat and the children and
repaired the former and brought back the latter?
</p>
<p>
Thus between sleeping and waking Ruth Kenway
lay until long after midnight. A faint mist,
as usual, rose from the sea and rolled inshore,
masking every object with a soft and glowing
mantle. She watched these wisps of fog until
her nerves were “jumpy” and her troubled mind
was filled with strange imaginings.
</p>
<p>
Figures seemed stalking along the open shore;
but she knew they made no sound and left no footprints
on the sand. They were merely phantoms
of her overwrought thought.
</p>
<p>
Then suddenly, but so sharply that she could
not deny its existence, something clattered out
there on the sea. She sat up with a gasp and
reached a nervous hand toward her sister.
</p>
<p>
Then she waited. Why arouse Agnes and
frighten her? It might not be anything of consequence.
</p>
<p>
The sound was repeated. Ruth could not identify
its cause, but she knew it could be no marine
creature. It was no noise made by the turtles
which sought the island each night at this season
of the year.
</p>
<p>
It was a man-made sound.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
The shadows in the fog did not trouble Ruth
now. There was something of greater moment
out there on the water, she was sure. Ruth crept
down to the open shore and listened.
</p>
<p>
A voice! She almost cried aloud, she was so
startled. And for a moment a thrill of delight
shocked the girl.
</p>
<p>
It was a rescue! Somebody had come looking
for them! She knew it could not be Mr. Howbridge
and the others returning, although she had
imagined such a thing as she lay there between
waking and sleeping.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, something told Ruth Kenway not
to shout. She determined to make no sound
until she knew more about these strangers. Or
at least, until it seemed that they might be
going away from Palm Island without investigating.
</p>
<p>
She now knew what the sounds were which had
first startled her. The anchor of a boat had
splashed overboard; then the sail had come rattling
down. Although the mist hid the craft, she
knew just about where it was lying.
</p>
<p>
Ruth strained her eyes to see. She strained
her ears to hear. Out of the mist she felt that
something was coming shoreward. Was it a small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
boat? Was a landing being made—and so softly
for a purpose? Who were these people? Were
they friends or enemies?
</p>
<p>
The echo of the voice reached her ears again—flatly
and, it seemed, scarcely human in its timbre.
But Ruth was confident that it was a man who
spoke and that he spoke roughly.
</p>
<p>
She could not expect that any rescue party sent
out from St. Sergius would be altogether made up
of the hotel guests. The boatmen engaged on
the waterfront for such a venture were likely to
be rather rough men.
</p>
<p>
When she heard the voice for a third time and
recognized the words as Spanish or Afro-Spanish
the oldest Corner House girl shrank back toward
the edge of the jungle in which the camp lay.
</p>
<p>
Had she heard English spoken by the party
coming ashore she would have raised her voice in
a glad shout. Now she hesitated, determining to
wait upon the landing before she made her presence
known.
</p>
<p>
“If they are looking for us they may say something
or do something to prove it,” she thought.
Ruth knew a few Spanish words and she began
to recall them to mind and get ready for an interview
with the strangers when such a moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
should arrive. “I suppose I ought to welcome the
coming of anybody at all. But these——”
</p>
<p>
A moving shape suddenly appeared in the mist.
A keel grated on the shore. Several voices, all
speaking a mixed Spanish, burst out. Ruth heard
Agnes stir again and cry out faintly.
</p>
<p>
The older girl threw herself into the shelter
and placed a hand over Agnes’ mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” she commanded.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh! What is it?” gasped the other.
</p>
<p>
“Wait. There is no danger—perhaps. But
they are strangers.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you saying?” Agnes Kenway demanded,
and sat up promptly, pushing her sister’s
restraining hand away.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you somebody has landed.”
</p>
<p>
“Not Mr. Howbridge and the boys?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not! Would I fear them?”
</p>
<p>
“Then you are frightened, Ruthie?” said her
sister. “Tell me.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth, however, would say no more. She went
back to the clump of brush overlooking the sands.
If the visitors should prove to be friends she
did not want them to escape before she called to
them.
</p>
<p>
The voices did not sound kindly at all. Ruth
hesitated. Agnes, creeping out after her, likewise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
listened to the broken snatches of conversation
which reached their ears.
</p>
<p>
“Pirates!” exploded the younger sister, her
lips close to Ruth’s ear.
</p>
<p>
“Pirates your grandmother!” returned Ruth,
exasperated.
</p>
<p>
“Wish Sammy Pinkney was here,” giggled Agnes,
for with all their trouble she could joke. “He
ought to be a judge of pirates by this time.”
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t laugh.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe not. But I won’t cry—yet,” said
Agnes, more cheerful than she had been for some
hours.
</p>
<p>
The two girls, clinging to each other’s hands in
the shivery mist, waited and listened. The men
who had landed from the boat evidently drew the
craft well up on the beach. Then some of them
walked up to the spring.
</p>
<p>
“Agnes!” ejaculated Ruth, impressively, but
in a very low voice.
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“They know this island. They are familiar
with it. They dropped their anchor right opposite
this place in the dark, and now they are coming
to the spring.”
</p>
<p>
“We-ell,” stammered Agnes, “maybe that is
good news.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“They are not likely, then, to be people sent
to hunt for us,” announced Ruth. “We must not
speak to them.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?” ejaculated Agnes. “Because we
haven’t been introduced?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be a goose. You sound like Neale
O’Neil. We must wait to get a good look at them
by daylight before we let them see us.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but, Ruthie,” whispered Agnes, “maybe
we might get them to go after the boys and
Tess and Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“They could not do that until morning. We
will wait,” Ruth declared firmly.
</p>
<p>
Her determination could not be shaken. Agnes
at this point might have been braver than her
sister, but she could not oppose Ruth in her present
mood.
</p>
<p>
The two girls stole off through the scrub timber
to the higher ground. They tried to make no
sound that would attract the attention of the men
who had landed on the island. And in this they
evidently succeeded, for their movements were
not observed by the strangers.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—THE ODYSSEY OF TESS AND DOT</h2>
<p>
Children, after all, are usually fearless when
they face material things. Danger does not often
frighten them if there is no mystery or weirdness
connected with it.
</p>
<p>
The fact that they were sailing upon an unmanageable
boat, upon an unknown sea, and were
quite helpless, did not disturb the slumbers of
Tess and Dot Kenway. As Tess had thought, the
motor-boat might bump into something; but staying
awake on their part would not ward off that
disaster.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Isobel</em> blundered along as the night fell,
and the children went to sleep supperless. Dot
did not even complain about this lack of a meal.
There was nobody to complain to, for she knew
Tess could not aid her.
</p>
<p>
The motor-boat drew closer in to the shore of
the first island. The tide and current sucked the
hull of the helpless craft nearer and nearer. As
it chanced, there was a point covered with palm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
trees around which the <em>Isobel</em> drifted. She was
then completely hidden from any part, even the
highest part, of Palm Island.
</p>
<p>
When the sun arose the next morning, as far
as the party back at the larger island knew, the
motor-boat might have been sunk beneath the surface
of the sea.
</p>
<p>
But that was not what had happened. The boat
grounded, swung around with the tide, and when
the sun got well above the sea its rays shone
straight into the open cabin door and into Dot
Kenway’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“O-oo! Tess!” she squealed. “I guess we
landed and didn’t know it. And the boat is pitching
over. O-oo!”
</p>
<p>
It was a fact that the deck of the <em>Isobel</em>—more
properly the floor of her cabin—lay at a steep
angle. The boat was quite snugly run upon the
sands. The tide had withdrawn and left her there.
</p>
<p>
The two wondering little girls climbed out of
their berths and crept to the door and so out into
the cockpit. They looked wonderingly over the
rail to the shore.
</p>
<p>
“Why!” observed Dot in wonder, “isn’t this
Plam Island?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! I wish you’d say <em>Palm</em> Island—and
it’s not Palm Island,” declared Tess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then what’s the use of saying it if it isn’t?”
grumbled Dot, who disliked being admonished
about her faults of pronunciation. “But it looks
like Plam Island, so now!”
</p>
<p>
“I guess all these islands look alike,” sighed
Tess, giving up her admonitory attitude for the
moment. “We had better go ashore.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?”
</p>
<p>
“Well! Aren’t you hungry?” Tess demanded.
“And do you want to stay on this pitched-over
boat?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m hungry all right,” agreed Dot. “But
nothing more can happen to the boat now, can
there? It’s wrecked, and that is all there is about
it. It is a good place to sleep in.”
</p>
<p>
“Are we going to sleep here again, do you suppose?”
Tess cried. “Why, of course Ruthie will
send the boys for us! Of course she will!”
</p>
<p>
“She hasn’t yet,” said Dot pessimistically.
</p>
<p>
“Not in the night. It’s too dark to see then.”
</p>
<p>
“And she doesn’t know where we are, does
she?” demanded Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same, they will find us. I’m hungry,”
Tess announced again.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we eat?” asked her sister.
</p>
<p>
But Tess was not nonplussed by that question.
Little as she was, she was observant. Such fruits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
as had been good to eat on Palm Island she knew
must be all right to eat here on this strange island.
</p>
<p>
Of course they had no fire and nothing to cook
upon it if they had. The little girls did not know
just how to go about finding turtles’ eggs, although
they had seen Neale O’Neil uncover the
first nestful of those delicacies. But they found
two or three cocoanuts which they broke open
with pieces of coral. And it was easy enough to
pick a lapful of fruit.
</p>
<p>
Down they squatted on the sand, each with her
dress-skirt heaped with fruit, and proceeded to
enjoy a repast. Before they had finished, the
active mind of Dot demanded to be informed on
another point.
</p>
<p>
“If Neale and Luke come after us, Tess Kenway,
how are they going to know we are on this
island?”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t they see us here?” asked her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Not if we are behind the bushes. I don’t mean
to stay out in the sun all the time. You know it
is awfully hot at noon.”
</p>
<p>
“We-ell,” considered Tess, “I s’pose I’ll have
to put up my skirt again. They won’t sail by
that.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s!” exclaimed Dot. Then she looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
up into the palm trees and again began to question.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t ever climb up one of those trees in
the world, Tess Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I can try,” stammered her sister.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll break your neck. You’ll get hurt like
Margy and Carrie Pendleton’s father got hurt,”
declared Dot. “I wish Sammy Pinkney was
here.”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” gasped Tess. “What for?”
</p>
<p>
“He could climb it. He’s a good climber. You
know how he climbed the cherry tree in Mrs.
Adams’ back yard,” said Dot earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” rejoined Tess with scorn. “And how
they had to call out the fire department to get him
down. I remember.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dot grumpily, for she almost always
stood up for Sammy, “I guess he would
have got down by himself if they had left him
alone. But Mrs. Adams got so nervous. Anyhow,
Tess Kenway, you can’t climb one of these
plam trees.”
</p>
<p>
“Did I say I could?” replied her sister, rather
snappishly if the truth were told.
</p>
<p>
But Tess was a very persistent person when
once she had made up her mind to a thing. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
walked along the shore for a long way, staring up
into the tops of the palms. The trunks were
rough enough, but they offered no means of climbing,
even had Tess dared the attempt. There
were no branches.
</p>
<p>
“I never did see such silly trees,” she told herself.
“I like the trees at home in Milton lots
better. Even in winter there are branches sticking
out so that you can climb into them if you
need to. If—if a mad dog comes along, or anything
like that. I wish we were back in Milton!”
</p>
<p>
Dot heard none of this, for she had settled herself
down comfortably under a bush and proceeded
to rearrange the Alice-doll’s clothes. That
young person was certainly sadly in need of a
fresh outfit, as Dot had herself stated some hours
before. But who could keep one’s clothing fresh
and tidy when cast away on an uninhabited island?
</p>
<p>
“It is too bad Sammy isn’t here—too bad for
him,” Dot called to the anxious Tess, after a minute
or two. “He’d so love to be wrecked, and in
danger of drowning, and being eaten up by turkles,
and all. He would be so excited.”
</p>
<p>
“He’d be a nuisance,” commented Tess, puzzling
her brain over the matter of the signal of
distress and nothing much else.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Dot,” she finally said. “Let’s go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
up to the other end of the island—the end nearest
Palm Island where Ruthie and the others are.
Maybe we’ll find a tree there.”
</p>
<p>
“There are plenty of trees here. I don’t see
why you can’t keep still, Tess Kenway. The sun’s
getting hot.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we want to go right away before it gets
any hotter,” and as Tess started off at once, Dot
was forced to get up and follow. She did not wish
to be left alone with the Alice-doll, although they
had seen nothing on the island as yet to affright
them.
</p>
<p>
There was no hill, or even a small mound, on
this little island. Just the level crust of earth
over the coral rocks crowded with low vegetation
out of which the palms shot in some instances to
a considerable height. But near the western end
of the island some of these trees had been laid
low—possibly in the hurricane which had driven
the <em>Isobel</em> and her crew to Palm Island. The
condition of the tangled palms was as though
they had writhed in agony and been uprooted at
last by giant hands.
</p>
<p>
One tall tree—and Tess spied it long before
she got to it—lay for fully forty feet almost along
the ground at the edge of the jungle. But its top
had been caught by a group of other palms. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
trunk of the uprooted tree afforded a slanting
walk right into the tops of the other palms!
</p>
<p>
“I can climb that!” declared Tess, quickly, and
began to unfasten her skirt.
</p>
<p>
The palm trunk was rough and husky. Climbing
it on hands and knees was a hard task, but not
particularly dangerous. As she kept her eyes
fixed ahead of her, Tess did not note particularly
the height to which she climbed.
</p>
<p>
Once in the tops of the several palms she was
easily able to fasten her plaid skirt out upon a
frond which had a free sweep toward the water.
This signal of distress was what the party on
Palm Island had seen just before the raft set sail
on its voyage of rescue.
</p>
<p>
Because Tess had climbed along the tree trunk
and hung out her banner, she felt more brave.
And even Dot looked at her sister in wide-eyed
admiration.
</p>
<p>
“I guess Ruthie would have scolded you, Tess,”
she said. “But you can climb almost as good as
Sammy.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sammy!” ejaculated Tess.
</p>
<p>
Having got into the wood, they went back afterward
through the middle of the island. And in
this way the two little girls came upon what to
them seemed a very strange place indeed. The
lianas and other vines made the walking difficult
and Tess had just said they would have to go
back to the shore when suddenly the two little
girls stepped right out into an opening where
there was a still blue lake as quiet and safe looking
as a millpond.
</p>

<span class='caption'>Climbing it on hands and knees was a hard<br/>task but not particularly dangerous.</span>
</div>
<p>
There was only a narrow ribbon of shore bordering
this circular pond of water. The jungle
grew almost to the edge of the water and the
palms shaded it completely, for it was not many
yards across.
</p>
<p>
As the sun’s rays were now hot, the look of this
pool was delightful. Dot got down on her hands
and knees to drink. But in a moment she sat back
again, sputtering and crying out:
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Isn’t that nasty mean, Tess Kenway?
It’s salt like all the rest of the water down here.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, there is no place where the sea runs in
that I can see,” Tess declared. She tasted the
water gingerly, then shook her head. “I guess
you are right, Dot. I don’t understand it. But
it is pretty in here, and cool.”
</p>
<p>
The two little girls remained at this pool all
day. Fruit was plentiful, fringing the open water.
They saw fish jump, or swimming in the clear
depths. Far below, among the coral formations,
the delicate seaweeds waved to and fro. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
was a submarine opening or openings into the
sea, but Tess and Dot scarcely understood the
nature or origin of this salt water basin in the
center of the little island.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally Dot sighed and made dismal complaint
that she wished Ruthie and the others would
come for them. But the fact remained that being
cast away on one island was just about the same
as being cast away on another.
</p>
<p>
They were so far from the careened motor-boat
that the sisters decided to remain where they were
over night. Occasionally during the afternoon
the two made a pilgrimage to the shore where
they could see the <em>Isobel</em>; but they saw nothing
else, and certainly did not catch sight of the raft
with Mr. Howbridge and Luke and Neale upon it.
</p>
<p>
The fast falling evening caught the little girls
by the edge of the pool in the middle of the island.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” said Tess, when Dot began to
sniffle a bit. “I don’t care if we do have to stay
here. Here the sand is warm and there are none
of those big turtles to crawl out and maybe
bite us.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I wish you wouldn’t,” gasped Dot. “I
had forgotten about those old turkles.”
</p>
<p>
The two sisters fell asleep as calmly as though
they were in their own beds at the old Corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
House. This was by no means the first night
they had been lost and had slept in the open air.
And nothing had ever really harmed them; though
it is true that they were frightened at times.
</p>
<p>
This occasion was no exception. They could
not have been sleeping two hours when first Tess
and then Dot was aroused. It was not the splashing
of the silvery water in the pool that aroused
them, but some sound—a groan or sigh that actually
seemed to have been uttered right in their
ears!
</p>
<p>
Up sat the two little girls, wide awake and with
wide-open eyes. They faced the pool. Out of
this, rising slowly and ghostily, was a glistening
gray body like a drowned giant that might have
suddenly come up to breathe.
</p>
<p>
And the sigh he uttered! It made the flesh of
Tess and Dot Kenway quiver to hear that sound
and the blood seemed to freeze in their veins.
</p>
<p>
“O-o-o-o-o-o!” moaned the mysterious ghost,
while the water poured in a gentle shower from
his shoulders.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—THE TURTLE CATCHERS</h2>
<p>
The two older Corner House girls, like the two
younger, were fear-ridden during at least a part
of that second night of their separation. But
perhaps Tess and Dot had much less to be really
afraid of than Ruth and Agnes.
</p>
<p>
The latter spent the remainder of the hours of
darkness after the strangers landed on Palm Island
at the foot of the great tree that topped the
hill above the camp that had been established
for the girls before the boys had taken to the raft
with Mr. Howbridge.
</p>
<p>
Crouched at the foot of the giant palm Ruth
and Agnes clung to each other, sleeping but fitfully,
until dawn. Aroused in the faint gray
light, the sisters crept down to the shelter of the
jungle again. They lay there, listening for
sounds from the camp which they believed the
Spanish-speaking crew of the mysterious craft
had made at the spring.
</p>
<p>
The men were not early astir. When the sun
was well up Ruth insisted upon going up the hill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
again and out into the open so that they could see
over a low place in the jungle to the cove where
the mysterious boat was anchored.
</p>
<p>
It was there in the mist. Agnes clung to her
sister’s arm and stared at it too. A somewhat
slovenly looking craft, wide of beam, unpainted,
with stubbed masts, old rigging, and a dirty
smother of canvas that had not been even reefed
when it was allowed to drop upon the deck.
</p>
<p>
If the appearance of the craft was a criterion
of the character of her crew, the girls hoped not
to see the latter at all!
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid to talk with them. I wish Mr.
Howbridge and the boys were here,” said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t we better ask these men to go in
search of Guardy and Luke and Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Should we? I wonder,” sighed Ruth. “Perhaps
they know something about the children.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we must ask them!” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Wait. They are up now. I hear them.”
</p>
<p>
In fact, within a very few moments the
girls heard the strangers down upon the beach.
The fog had lain upon the shore and sea in a low
curtain for some minutes after the sun came up.
Now by the shouting they heard, Ruth and Agnes
knew that the crew ashore was chasing and capturing
the turtles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess these men are just turtle catchers,”
Ruth said reflectively. “They go from island to
island capturing the turtles. It is not likely that
a gentleman like Señor Benno would have engaged
such men to search for us. I am afraid
of them, Agnes.”
</p>
<p>
“So am I, dear. Unless we tell them that we
have friends and a motor-boat near——”
</p>
<p>
“But they will want to know why the motor-boat
does not come after us. No. We must remain
hidden.”
</p>
<p>
They dared not go back to their camp under
the rock. The turtle catchers would of course
find that retreat. But as long as they did not
know that the campers were girls who were still
on the island, Ruth hoped the fellows would make
no search for them.
</p>
<p>
After a while Agnes tired of staying hidden in
the jungle. Besides, the insects became very
troublesome as the day grew warmer.
</p>
<p>
“And how do we know but Mr. Howbridge and
the boys are trying to signal to us? At least,
they may have found the children and be in sight
again.”
</p>
<p>
“I really hope you will keep quiet, Agnes,”
said the older girl. “I do not want to attract
these men. They do look awfully rough.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know!” sighed Agnes. “Do you suppose
the turtle catchers will remain long?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know just how they follow their—their
profession,” hesitated Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Profession!” giggled Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“But they will probably remain here until they
have made a complete haul of the turtles that
come to this shore. I do not think any great
numbers were here last night. Neale said something
about the numbers fluctuating very much,
did he not?”
</p>
<p>
“That boy reads and absorbs so much,” declared
Agnes. “To think of his knowing about
sea-turtles at all!”
</p>
<p>
“If we ever come into this locality again,” said
Ruth, “I shall want to be informed upon a lot
of topics that I never considered of moment.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d think Neale O’Neil had expected to be
cast away on a desert island,” declared the
younger sister. “He makes a play of it.”
</p>
<p>
“He takes it too lightly, I fear,” sighed Ruth.
“But let us hope he will not take the search for
Tess and Dot too lightly. The poor dears!
What might not have happened to them in these
two days?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” rejoined Agnes, “we know what happened
to them for part of the time. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
safe enough when they drifted out of our sight
night before last.”
</p>
<p>
“Safe enough!” repeated Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“At least, they had not been drowned,” her
sister said convincingly. “And I do believe,
dear—somehow I feel it!—that nothing actually
bad has happened to them. Guardy and the
boys will find them safe and sound.”
</p>
<p>
“I can only hope so. And I hope they find the
boat safe and sound as well. If they can finish
repairing it——Oh, dear me! Why was I foolish
enough the other day to insist upon their
stopping in the repair work and finding water
first?”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” exclaimed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I blame myself,” declared the older girl. “If
I had been content the engine would have been
working and the children could not have drifted
away on the <em>Isobel</em>. Dear me! I am always
doing something for which I condemn myself
afterward.”
</p>
<p>
“I know you condemn yourself, Ruthie, all
right,” returned Agnes. “But I do not think
you are always just. See how you blamed yourself
for our going to Carrie Poole’s dance and
getting cold. One would never think we ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
had a cold now! You are as brown as a berry
and I am positively getting fat.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not so sure that I am to be the less condemned
for our having foolishly taken chances
with our health back home. If it hadn’t been for
that we should not be in this situation, that is
sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! You are unreasonable, I think,”
murmured Agnes, and said no more at the time.
</p>
<p>
She insisted, however, upon stealing up the hill
to the foot of the palm tree and gazing off across
the sea to the east in the hope of seeing some sign
of their friends. Ruth could not restrain Agnes
from doing this every couple of hours.
</p>
<p>
The binoculars had been left with them, and
Agnes scanned sharply every observable foot of
the nearest island. The spot where the <em>Isobel</em>
lay was around on the far side, however; and
what had become of the raft was as great a mystery
to the girls.
</p>
<p>
About noon she came hurriedly back to Ruth,
however, and told her that the thing that had been
fluttering so long from the top of the palm tree
on that other island was gone.
</p>
<p>
“Blown away?” remarked Ruth thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think so. The wind is not blowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
very hard. I wish I had sat right up there and
kept the glasses on that tree. I might have seen
something.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose it was removed by Guardy
or the boys?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not? If it was put up by Tess and
Dot——”
</p>
<p>
“In that tall tree! Impossible.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, are there two parties of castaways?”
demanded Agnes, rather crossly.
“Everything I suggest you pick flaws in,
Ruthie.”
</p>
<p>
But Ruth hugged her, and the younger sister
returned her caress with real affection. Their
trouble was too deep for them really to wrangle.
The anxiety each felt drew them closer together.
</p>
<p>
If of late Agnes had felt herself shut away
from Ruth’s closer confidence because of the
older girl’s interest in Luke Shepard, this experience
on the tropical island was renewing the
sisters’ old-time contact and appreciation of each
other. It was true Agnes was hoydenish at
times, and loved to play with Neale O’Neil and
the other boys; but she was growing older every
day, too, and many of the secrets and interests
of girlhood she could share only with Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Cheer up!” she now exclaimed, wiping the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
tears from her sister’s eyes with the cleanest corner
of her only handkerchief. “Surely we need
not go through much more worriment. This situation
is past being made any worse, that is
sure.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish it may be so,” murmured Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it is. Things will take a turn.
We’ll soon see the <em>Isobel</em> scooting around the end
of that island and heading this way.”
</p>
<p>
But this much desired sight did not gladden
their eyes. Even Ruth climbed to the palm tree
to watch. And it was because the two girls remained
up there that the final incident of their
adventure on the island came to fruition. They
were seen from the deck of the frowsy schooner!
</p>
<p>
They were startled by a raucous shout from
the sea. Turning her glasses in that direction,
Ruth beheld a ragamuffin sailor half way up the
foremast of the turtle catcher waving his cap at
them.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Agnes, they have seen us!” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s—let’s run and hide!” murmured the
younger girl.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that that will do much good.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it will,” cried Agnes. “That is, if
we hide so well that they cannot find us.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it would be better to face them and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
make them think that we have men friends near
at hand.”
</p>
<p>
“No chance,” urged Agnes. “We can’t fool
them. They will know that we have been hiding
from them. If there were men in our party they
would have already shown up. No, Ruth, we
can’t fool ’em that way.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you are right,” sighed the older sister.
“But where shall we hide?”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go back to the other point—where the
<em>Isobel</em> was moored. When the boys return they
will come there first, of course.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes spoke much more confidently than she
felt. Like her sister she had a strong dislike to
meeting these turtle catchers. She had seen that
class of natives on the water front at St. Sergius,
and their appearance had rather intimidated even
Agnes, who usually felt no fear of any of her
fellow men.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—THE GROAN OF A GRAMPUS</h2>
<p>
The startled and sleepy children beside the
pool on the smaller island clung together in
speechless terror for the few minutes following
their being aroused by the marine “ghost” that
had risen through the waters. Its glistening,
high-shouldered body was a most mysterious
sight, that was true.
</p>
<p>
The starlight was so vivid, however, that soon
Tess and Dot were able to distinguish the outlines
of the beast more clearly. No denial could
be made of its voice, for it puffed out a most astonishing
sigh. Nothing like this beast had
either girl ever imagined.
</p>
<p>
“O-oo!” murmured Dot. “Look at the
whale!”
</p>
<p>
She came not far from the proper designation.
It was a grampus. But a grampus is a cetacean,
and that is the family to which whales belong.
The grampus stood on its tail in the water, with
the greater upper part of its body exposed, and
sighed again as though its heart were broken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
Then it flung itself flat upon the water with a
splash that must have echoed to the far end of
the island. At least, Dot Kenway’s shriek of
fear echoed that far.
</p>
<p>
“Stop yelling. It’s gone,” said Tess.
</p>
<p>
“But he spattered me all over,” sobbed the
smaller girl. “Oh! I don’t like this place, Tess.
The whales come in and wake you up and—and——”
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” commanded Tess, hearing something
new. “Listen.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t hush,” sobbed Dot. “Is it another
whale?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s—it’s——Oh, Dot Kenway!” shrieked
Tess suddenly, and darted up from the sand, “it’s
Neale O’Neil!”
</p>
<p>
This was a sufficiently impressive declaration
to stop Dot’s sobs and complaints. She staggered
hastily to her feet, clinging to her sister,
and joined her voice to the latter’s in shrieking:
“Help!”
</p>
<p>
Just what they wanted help for now that the
grampus was gone, was a question quite beside
the situation. The little girls continued to
scream. Neale’s voice answered them. They
heard other voices.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we are rescued, Tess,” gulped Dot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
“They have found out where we are. No use
yelling any more.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to shout till I see them,” said the
practical Tess, who did not propose giving their
friends any chance to get away from them.
</p>
<p>
Neale came crashing through the brush after
a time. Luke and Mr. Howbridge were right behind
him, and Luke carried a flashlight. The
ray of this flashed into the girls’ faces just as another
splash and groan was heard from the pool.
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake! What’s that?” demanded
the lawyer, panting in the rear of the trio.
</p>
<p>
“No wonder the kids yelled!” exclaimed Neale.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” cried Luke.
</p>
<p>
They were startled to see the glistening,
ghostly object rise from the depths. But they
loudly greeted Tess and Dot. The latter explained:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s a whale come up to breathe. He
scared us dreadful!”
</p>
<p>
Luke named the creature correctly the next moment.
“And they are not often seen, I understand.
They’re enough to frighten a high school
at night, let alone a couple of little kiddies.”
</p>
<p>
He grabbed Tess and Dot, one in the crook of
each arm, and kissed them soundly as he raised
them to his shoulders. Mr. Howbridge exclaimed over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
the lost children, too, and afterward
Dot told Tess that she had no idea their guardian
“could cry.”
</p>
<p>
There was reason for Mr. Howbridge shedding
a few tears over the recovery of the smallest
Kenways. The stranding of the <em>Isobel</em> on this
island in safety had been a miracle indeed. A
hundred untoward things might have happened to
the children.
</p>
<p>
A little after nightfall the boys and Mr. Howbridge
had worked their raft into the shallow
cove where the motor-boat lay and had landed.
Looking for Tess and Dot in the dark of the tropical
night was almost a hopeless task.
</p>
<p>
By chance Neale had heard Dot’s shriek when
she had been frightened by the marine monster
in the pool. Charging across the island, he had
led the way to the small sisters.
</p>
<p>
That night, about the fire on the shore, was a
cheerful one indeed for the boys and the lawyer
while the little girls slept soundly. Their discovery
and recovery of Tess and Dot by the trio of
searchers had been easier than they had hoped in
their most sanguine moments.
</p>
<p>
“And Ruth will certainly be a happy girl
again,” Luke often repeated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hope we can get back to them soon,” Neale
rejoined.
</p>
<p>
“Wish we could signal to them that the children
are found,” ruminated Luke.
</p>
<p>
The nearest they could do in the matter of signaling
was to take down Tess’ plaid skirt from
the top of the palm tree the next morning. This
Neale did after a while, and he praised Tess for
thinking of putting up the skirt in the first place.
</p>
<p>
“If I finally decide to spend the rest of my life
on a desert island, Tessie,” Neale said soberly,
“I’ll take you along as a partner.”
</p>
<p>
“No, you won’t,” said Tess promptly. “For I
won’t go, Neale O’Neil. I don’t ever expect to be
cast away again, so there!”
</p>
<p>
Early in the afternoon the trio got the motor-boat
into the water again and anchored it off
shore. The mechanism was already adjusted.
It had to be tried out, changed a little, and finally
set to running. There was sufficient gasoline to
carry them a long way if the machinery ran perfectly.
</p>
<p>
Had Ruth and Agnes not been so frightened by
the fact that their presence on Palm Island had
been discovered by the turtle fishers, they would
surely have spied the <em>Isobel</em> when she first came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
into view from behind the smaller island where
Tess and Dot had been marooned.
</p>
<p>
The older girls hid in the jungle down by the
rocky point and waited through the evening in
much alarm. They heard and even saw some of
the rough men passing and repassing the place of
their concealment. They dared not go to sleep,
and feared that they would have to remain awake,
and in hiding, until another day.
</p>
<p>
But while the minutes crept by so slowly,
Agnes, quick-eared as well as sharp of eye, began
to hear a sound that at first puzzled then excited
her. She seized Ruth more tightly in her arms.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie! Listen! What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Sh! They will hear you,” murmured her sister.
</p>
<p>
“I—I want them to, I guess,” choked Agnes.
“Hear that? It’s the chugging of a motor-boat,
Ruth!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, never!” exclaimed the older girl, but getting
up to her knees.
</p>
<p>
“It is the <em>Isobel</em>. Surely it is. They are coming!
Neale! Neale!”
</p>
<p>
Wildly excited at last, the younger girl leaped
to her feet and bounded out of concealment. As
she landed in the sand and struck out for the
rocky point, Ruth heard a shout behind them and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
the heavy tread of men running down the beach.
</p>
<p>
“Agnes! Agnes! They will catch us!” she
shrieked, and ran madly after her sister.
</p>
<p>
Agnes thought of nothing, however, but the
fact, as she believed, that their friends were near
at hand. She climbed upon the highest boulder
in the neighborhood and shrieked a welcome.
</p>
<p>
“Neale! Guardy! Luke! Here we are!”
cried the wild girl. “Are the children safe?
Tessie! Dot! Tell Agnes if you are all right!”
</p>
<p>
Her wild cry was echoed from the sea. She
could even observe the <em>Isobel</em> approaching. And
the voices of the children and those of the boys
and Mr. Howbridge were soon distinguishable.
</p>
<p>
Had the turtle fishers intended the two girls
any harm, these cries from the water and the approach
of the motor-boat must have warned the
natives. Ruth and Agnes stood on the rock, and
the fishermen approached to within a few yards
of them.
</p>
<p>
They chattered much in Spanish, and then one
spoke in English:
</p>
<p>
“Eet ees that the <em>señoritas</em> haf friend—<em>amigo</em>—in
the boat—no?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell them that we’ve got friends coming,
<em>yes</em>!” exclaimed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Ruth could remember just about enough Spanish to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
make herself understood. She told the
fishermen their friends had been away in the
motor-boat but were now arriving.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! If the señors should weesh help of any
kind, we are of the willingness to do—<em>si</em>,
<em>señorita</em>!” exclaimed the man, and led his comrades
away along the beach just as the <em>Isobel</em>, by
the light of the stars, shoved her nose into the little
inlet.
</p>
<p>
The boys leaped ashore the moment the motor-boat
was near enough to the rocky landing. Such
a noisy time as it was for a minute, with Tess and
Dot shrieking greetings and the boys hurrahing!
Suddenly Agnes was heard to say sharply:
</p>
<p>
“I like your impudence, Neale O’Neil! Who
said you could do that, I’d like to know?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t lay it up against me,” drawled her boy
chum. “Really couldn’t help it. I merely followed
Luke’s example.”
</p>
<p>
“Come, come!” exclaimed Mr. Howbridge.
“No quarreling there—especially on such a joyful
occasion. Who were those men I saw?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes ran to meet him as he moored the boat
and explained about the turtle fishers and told
how frightened she and Ruth had been.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well! Perhaps they are harmless.
But what do you say, boys? The engine is working like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
a charm, and the night is lovely. Had
we better not head for St. Sergius before something
worse happens to us?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Ruth, clasping her hands, “that
sounds sweet.”
</p>
<p>
“Guess we all have got enough of Palm Island,”
said Luke.
</p>
<p>
The bigger girls had by this time got aboard
the motor-boat to greet Tess and Dot. The four
sisters cuddled down in the cockpit and chattered
like four magpies. There was so much to
tell!
</p>
<p>
The <em>Isobel</em> was therefore backed around and
headed out of the little harbor once more. There
was nothing much on the island that they would
need. And, in any case, Mr. Howbridge considered
it quite as well to get away without coming
into contact with the turtle catchers.
</p>
<p>
Everything that had happened to the little girls
had to be told over and over again, right down to
the excitement of the grampus—which Dot insisted
upon calling a grandpa.
</p>
<p>
“But he wasn’t anything like Margaret and
Holly Pease’s grandpa—for he’s real nice,”
added the littlest Corner House girl with her
usual loose association of ideas. “He’s got the
nicest white hair and a gold-headed cane——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not the grampus, Dot,” groaned Tess, in despair.
</p>
<p>
“No; of course not that grandpa. Margaret
and Holly Pease’s. You’ve seen his gold-headed
cane yourself, Tess Kenway. I wish you
wouldn’t always interrupt me. Now—now,”
and she yawned, “I forget—forget what I was
going to say.”
</p>
<p>
She proceeded almost instantly to go fast
asleep with her head in Ruth’s lap.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—TYING ALL THE THREADS</h2>
<p>
The evening following, the <em>Isobel</em> poked her
nose into the passage past the fort and ran into
the harbor of St. Sergius. It was true that her
appearance was not noted by the whole city and
the welcome of the lost ones acclaimed by naval
broadsides and the city factory whistles. Nevertheless,
the cause of their absence had been suspected
and the boat of the harbor police ran
alongside the <em>Isobel</em> before she reached her usual
mooring-buoy.
</p>
<p>
It seemed that Señor Benno had been to the
other side of the island and had returned only
that day and made inquiries about his friend,
Mr. Howbridge, and his boat. Some inquiries
had been addressed to the authorities by people
at the hotel, too, and the authorities were very
glad indeed to learn of the safe return of the
Americanos.
</p>
<p>
“They needn’t fret,” sighed Agnes. “They
are not half as glad to have us back as we are to
get back. What say, Ruthie?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth hugged Tess and Dot and nodded. It
had been a very difficult experience for Ruth
Kenway. Secretly she was determined that the
smaller children should never be out of her sight
again as long as they remained at St. Sergius.
</p>
<p>
Agnes and Neale were welcomed with much hilarity
by the young people of their clique at the
St. Sergius Arms, and when they had heard of all
the wonderful experiences through which the absentees
had passed the two were more popular
than ever.
</p>
<p>
Nalbro Hastings was really quite overpowering
in her attentions to Agnes, and the latter was not
a little proud that the wealthy Back Bay girl
should think so much of her. Agnes had begun
to realize, however, that Miss Hastings was really
worth while and that she was simple in tastes and
kindly of intention.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I like her because she’s her,” Agnes
confessed to Neale. “You said she was a good
scout, and she is. But it must just be wonderful
after all to be so rich.”
</p>
<p>
“Wealth won’t keep you from getting your
teeth knocked out if you fall from a horse,”
chuckled Neale O’Neil. “Sure, she’s a good
sport. But she’s nowhere near as pretty as you
are, Aggie.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot might have been inclined to brag
a little about their adventures on “Plam” Island,
as Dot insisted upon calling it. But they found
waiting for them a letter from Sammy Pinkney,
and that youthful scribe managed to invest his
personal achievements with such a glamor of adventure
that even the romance of being cast away
on an uninhabited island paled into insignificance.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 4em;'>
“<em>Dere Tess and Dot:</em>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 4em;'>
“If mom wil let me alon and not mak me tak
and lok into the spelin bok evry minit or so Ile

“Yore Belgn hare that you wen off and lef is

Missus Mack is alright. And Con Murpy’s pig

Wyte sewer and the street depatmen had to come
and get him out and Con was mad. So evrybody

</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 4em;'>
“We got a dandy slid on Power Street and Shot
Pendlton went through the barb wire fens but I
diden and droped off and he was cut up sumpn
ferce and got a black eye fightin a feller that said
his father stole. But it was another feller done
it and Shot’s father went back to work for Kolbeck
and Roods.”
</p>
<p>
Right at this point the Kenway sisters and
their boy friends, as well as Mr. Howbridge, became
very much excited. It was the first intimation
they had had of the result of the inquiry into
the Pendleton’s troubles. Sammy Pinkney had
nothing further to say about “Shot” Pendleton’s
father and his affairs, although his letter to Tess
and Dot was both exhaustive and exciting. The
next day’s mail, however, brought a considerable
communication from Mr. Howbridge’s clerk in
whose charge the lawyer had left the Pendleton
case.
</p>
<p>
Ruth in particular had taken so deep an interest
in the family that the news of the solving of
the mystery about the stolen silks was a matter
that held her attention, if it did not that of her
sisters.
</p>
<p>
“I am so delighted to know that the shadow is
lifted from that poor man’s reputation,” she said
to Mr. Howbridge. “And all the while the man
who appeared to befriend him was the guilty
one!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
“You possess intuition developed to the nth
degree, Ruth,” said Mr. Howbridge, smiling. “I
remember that you said that Israel Stumpf
seemed to be two-faced. And he was. Scandal
in the Kolbeck family, my clerk writes. Kolbeck
would not save Stumpf even to please his wife.
The young man is out on bail, but he certainly
will be punished for stealing.”
</p>
<p>
“And have they taken Mr. Pendleton back?”
</p>
<p>
“So I am told here. At a little better salary
and in a place of increased responsibility. Kolbeck
is a decent man. He means to do what he
sees is right, I fancy.”
</p>
<p>
When Tess and Dot understood more fully the
final outcome of the trouble that had for so long
disturbed the Pendleton children—Margy and
Carrie as well as their brother—they both wanted
to write home to the little Pendletons about it.
</p>
<p>
“We’re so glad that nice Mr. Pendleton isn’t
going to be called a thief any more,” Tess remarked
to Ruth, “that we want to let ’em know
how we feel. Besides, I guess Mrs. Pendleton is
happy now, too.”
</p>
<p>
“And he’s a very interesting man, I think,”
added Dot. “I never knew another man who fell
out of a tree. Did you, Tess?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” drawled Tess. “I guess I never did.
And it is so nice that he is proved to be honest.
How happy Margy and Carrie will be.”
</p>
<p>
So the little girls sat down that evening to write
to the little Pendleton girls. This got Agnes and
Neale started. They, too, had been warmly interested
in the Pendleton case and in spite of the
many and exciting things they had to think of at
the St. Sergius Arms, the chums felt that they
would like to express their congratulations to
Mrs. Pendleton.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well!” said Mr. Howbridge, laughing,
as he saw all the Corner House party preparing
to bombard the Pendletons with written communications.
“Suppose we get up a round robin
of congratulation, all sign it, and send it to the
Pendletons? And we will send them something
with it that will be more material, if you all agree.
What do you say to a case of fruit?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Dot, suddenly. “And an alligator.
One of those baby ones. I guess Margy
and Carrie would like one for a pet.”
</p>
<p>
But Ruth managed to steer the littlest girl off
that topic. The alligator went home to Milton
later as a present to Sammy Pinkney. It was a
memento of the Corner House Girls’ stay at St.
Sergius bound to fill young Sammy with delight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
and his mother with distaste. Still, as Neale
pointed out, it was little worse when considered
as a house-pet than the Belgian hare.
</p>
<p>
That single trip of exploration sufficed for all
the Kenway party while they remained at St. Sergius.
Professor Keeps had scarcely noticed Luke
Shepard’s absence, although it had been for almost
a week. He was a very absent-minded professor,
indeed. But once the young man was at
his work again, the botanist kept him busy.
</p>
<p>
Luke was interested in the work too. He gave
himself over to the botanical excursions and the
Corner House girls had to find their fun and excitement
without his help.
</p>
<p>
Neale was able to assist Mr. Howbridge in certain
business matters as well. He rode often to
Señor Benno’s principal estate at the further end
of the island, and this took him from Agnes more
than that young person liked.
</p>
<p>
“There’s not much fun without Neale around,”
she confessed to Ruth. “He aggravates me, and
pokes fun at me, and all. But he leaves a sort of
emptiness behind him when he’s gone.”
</p>
<p>
“Get better acquainted with the other girls,”
advised Ruth sympathetically. “There are some
nice ones here.”
</p>
<p>
To this statement Agnes Kenway agreed. One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
girl especially appealed to her. Nalbro Hastings
proved upon further acquaintance to be just as
sweet and companionable as she had seemed to be
at first.
</p>
<p>
“And she is coming to see us,” Agnes told Ruth.
“She has promised to come to Milton this spring.
Just think! The old Corner House will have to
put its best foot forward to entertain <em>the</em> Nalbro
Hastings. I’m glad we’ve got a car. But don’t
you think, Ruthie, we can afford a neat little
maid with a cap and apron? Linda is so clumsy.”
</p>
<p>
“Neale would say you wanted to ‘put on dog,’”
ventured Ruth, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Now, dear! Consider! This girl is used to
<em>everything</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Then she must be used to flat-footed Finn
servant girls,” declared Ruth gaily. “She must
take us as we are.” And although she seconded
her sister’s invitation very warmly to the Back
Bay girl, Ruth made up her mind that she should
not be foolishly catered to.
</p>
<p>
People came to the St. Sergius Arms to rest;
but the Kenway party seemed to find little time
for that. For the younger set there was something
gay doing almost every day and evening.
And when it came time for Mr. Howbridge to take
his flock back to the north there was a gay masquerade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
dance engineered in honor particularly
of Ruth and Agnes.
</p>
<p>
It was a very gay occasion, quite the gayest
indeed that the sisters had ever entered into.
Even the Poole dance early in the winter, where
they had so unfortunately caught cold, had not
delighted Agnes so much. And Ruth could not
fail to be charmed, everything about the masquerade
ball was so well done.
</p>
<p>
Luke would remain some weeks longer with
Professor Keeps. But he was on hand for the
ball.
</p>
<p>
Were Tess and Dot forgotten? They most certainly
were not! Dot went as a fairy, gauzy wings
and all, while Tess was Little Bo-Peep and carried
a crook.
</p>
<p>
“Though you haven’t got any sheep, Tess,” observed
Dot critically. “You haven’t even got one
of those big turtles to drive! So I don’t see what
good that big cane does you.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d look nice trying to drive Mr. Methuselah,
wouldn’t I?” said her sister scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“I could ride on him,” giggled Dot. “That
was funny. I guess Sammy Pinkney would say
it was funny. I wish Sammy could see Cristuff
Columbo and Julius Cæsar—though that’s the
name of Bill Monnegan’s horse.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now, Dot Kenway!” exclaimed Tess, “you
are going to take home that alligator to Sammy.
You can’t take all the reptiles in the world to him.
You couldn’t put one of those turtles in our
trunk.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well,” sighed Dot. “But I know Sammy
won’t believe it if he doesn’t see those turkles. I
say, Tess!”
</p>
<p>
“Well? What is it?” asked her unruffled sister.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know, I just believe that after we tell
Sammy Pinkney about all we did and saw and
about the turkles that the next time he runs away
to be a pirate he’ll go to Plam Island. I just
know he will,” and she repeated her statement
with the utmost confidence.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
